The statue is carved from polished, reddish-brown wood. The column is divided into three sections for the head, torso, and legs. In this photograph, the man faces us. He has gold-colored eyes under arched brows, a wide nose, thin lips, and a square jaw. The horns rise from over his temples. In the middle section, he holds his hands in front of his chest, nearly touching as if in prayer. The bottom section shows his shins, knees together. His feet, which are roughly carved, turn outward. The base along the bottom is carved with words painted in gold, reading, “PERE PAILLARO.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/04b0b600-7f6b-41b6-b194-10ff7103fcf8/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

We seem to look slightly down onto the woman’s shoulders and onto the surface of the table. The white tabletop takes up most of the bottom half of the composition, and, seen from the knees up, the woman leans in from the lower right corner. The woman’s chestnut-brown hair is pulled up into a bun, and she wears a dark earring in her left ear. Her denim-blue dress is speckled with white dots and highlighted with strokes of blush pink. Her sleeves are rolled up to the elbow, and a dusty rose-pink apron covers her brown skirt. She presses down on the iron with her right hand, farther from us, and uses her left hand to straighten the fabric of the shirt collar. The iron has a thick handle and a flat, narrow, triangular surface used to press out wrinkles. A small, empty, bronze-colored bowl and crisply starched and folded porcelain-white shirt lie on the table to her left, closer to us. A row of hanging garments in pale crepe pink, flaxen gold, teal, and lavender purple soften the light coming into the room from three vertical windows, which are covered with sheer, ivory-white curtains. The artist’s feathery brushstrokes give the painting a hazy quality. The artist signed the work with olive-green letters near the lower left corner: “Degas.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/05a612fd-23ad-4862-8ba2-84811c563c5a/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

Many of the colors are layered like strata in a canyon. A few objects are more recognizable, like a loosely painted pink kettle with royal-blue highlights at the back next to a bottle outlined with blue against the background. A spring-green teapot with a peach lid is to our right. The surface, presumably the table, is painted in tones of marigold and pumpkin orange. The left two-thirds of the background is painted with strokes of lavender-blue and mauve-pink streaked with cream white. The rightmost third is lapis blue. The artist signed the painting in the upper right corner, “Henri Matisse.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/06ef1671-16e0-4706-b7c7-7cb85e4d9002/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The orange terracotta pot has patches of vivid spring green around its base. The rounded leaves of the plant and petals of the blossom are outlined in black and filled in with areas of parakeet and moss green for the leaves and pink for the petals. The pot sits on a bright, lavender-purple ledge, and two more shelves are stacked behind it. A single terracotta pot sits to our left behind the plant on the lower shelf, and four pots are lined up on the shelf above, cut off by the top edge of the canvas. Brushstrokes are visible throughout. A turquoise strip runs along the bottom edge of the composition, and the artist signed the lower right corner, “Henri Matisse.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/08d167d8-182c-4780-88c6-37b7b902fa31/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

To our left, the woman sits with her body facing us, and she looks at us with dark eyes under dark, arched brows. She has an oval face, a straight nose, and her coral-pink lips are closed. The woman’s dark brown hair is parted down the middle, and smoothed and pulled back to the base of her head. Her pinkish-tan dress has a narrow white collar and a full, billowing skirt. A loosely painted, crimson-red shawl wraps around her torso and is pulled over white, puffy sleeves. Also loosely painted, a shell-shaped, tan object to our right could be a fan held in her left hand. To our right and on the far side of the piece of furniture, the man sits on the low back of the chaise-longue, his left knee bent so that thigh, closer to us, rests along the back of the sofa. He turns his face to look at us from the corners of his eyes. He has a rounded nose, and his full, pink lips are closed. He has an auburn-brown beard and his short hair is tousled. He wears a brown coat and charcoal-gray slacks. He rests the hand closer to us against his hip so his elbow juts toward us. To either side of the people and nearly spanning the width of the painting, the arms of the chaise curve upward to about the height of the woman’s shoulders. A loosely painted, ball-like form next to the left arm of the chaise could be a hat or other object on a side table. The wall behind the people extends from the left edge of the painting to just behind the man, and is patterned with evergreen-colored dots to create floral patterns along vertical beige-colored stripes, all against a moss-green background. A golden yellow, vertical line near the left edge of the painting may be the frame of a mirror or painting. Beyond the man, to our right, a doorway opens to another room with mustard-yellow walls with white molding along the ceiling. A ghostly outline in ash-gray suggests a woman wearing a full skirt, long sleeved jacket, and hat in the room beyond. The paint in some areas is thinly applied or scraped away, especially in the people’s clothing.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/08f3f26d-bca4-46a6-8df8-d5572d944eb4/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

To our right, the woman rides the creature side-saddle, with both legs facing us, but she turns her torso to face the crowd to our left. She holds up a tall, ornate, lidded chalice with her right hand, farther from us, and her other hand rests in her lap. The woman has delicate features, seen almost in profile, and ringlets frame her face. The rest of her hair is pulled up under a jeweled crown, and she wears a pearl necklace. Her bodice is belted at the waist before falling past her feet. Her sleeves are off the shoulder and come to her elbows, and ornaments there could be jewels and more pearls. The creature she rides has talons for the front and back legs, with a plume of feathers and a tapering, snake-like tail at the back. Wings at the beast’s shoulders might be folded under the woman. Each of the seven faces of the creature has a long, serpentine neck with the head of a different animal with horns added, including a goat, bird, camel, and other imaginary animals. To our left, the group is made up of six men and one woman, with the tops of about a dozen hats indicating a crowd beyond. One man stands with his back to us, wearing a turban, a long, fur-lined cloak, and chains and jewels around his neck. Facing us, another man is cleanshaven with a double chin, and he wears a hat cocked to one side. Others wear a long floppy cap, a feathered cap, or monk’s robes. Densely packed slivers of faces and hats are jumbled together beyond, and the spiked blade of a halberd rises above the crowd. The group and creature seem to stand near the edge of a body of water, with plants and rocks scattered around their feet. The water stretches into the distance beyond the creature to a town being consumed by flames, to our right. Two masted ships and a rowboat float in the water near the shoreline, which leads back to distant mountains. Two winged angels with flowing, curly hair appear within coiling, twisting clouds in the sky above. One gestures toward the scene below with arms spread wide and the other holds a disk-like millstone. Also in the sky, to our left and smaller in scale, an armored man riding a horse raises a sword high overhead. Dozens of faces create a second crowd disappearing into the cloud banks beyond the rider. The artist signed the work with a D tucked into the legs of an A at the lower center.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/0a2fce4a-5873-40f4-ac8d-950e4470e5c5/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

Her chestnut-brown hair is pulled up and back. The orange dress has a band of charcoal gray across the shoulders and at the flaring cuffs. Wide, vertical pleats fall from under the band across her chest. White trim, perhaps lace or fur, is suggested by loosely painted cream white at the high neck.

The scene is loosely painted with touches of vibrant color. In the top third of the composition, the shallowly arched bridge nearly touches the top edge of the canvas, and it extends off each side. The shadows on the bridge are painted with eggplant purple. Bands of waterlilies gently zigzag into the distance on the surface of the water. The spring and emerald-green grasses growing along the banks fill the space around and over the pond, and they blend into a screen of trees beyond that enclose the scene. The green of the grasses and trees is reflected in the surface of the water, as is the underside of the bridge. The artist signed and dated the work with dark paint in the lower right corner: “Claude Monet 99.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/0b9cefb5-1ee4-401a-8154-8d4039191a28/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The sleeveless, putty-gray bodice of her costume fits tightly above a layered, fabric, pale, tea-brown tutu, and she wears ballet shoes. Her hair is pulled back but bangs sweep across her forehead, brushing her nearly closed, heavy eyelids. Her lips are slightly parted, and light catches the broad planes of her cheekbones. Her shoulders are drawn back by her pose, holding her hands behind her with arms straight, and her hips jut slightly forward. She stands with her right foot extended in front of her, with both feet turned out, parallel to each other.

The structure has sand-colored stone pillars, a wooden triangular, pitched roof, and a straw floor. Mary, who has an elongated torso, sits facing us with her knees apart. She wears an azure-blue robe over a rose-pink dress. A shell-pink veil covers her head and body. Jesus sits on her left knee, his pudgy body angled to our left. He is nude except for a transparent cloth wrapped over one shoulder and the opposite hip. Mary’s left hand braces his torso. On Mary’s right, our left, Joseph, an older man, stands facing us. He clasps his hands at his chest and leans on a long stick. He has wrinkled skin, long, gray curly hair, and a full beard. Both Mary and Joseph tilt their heads to their right, our left, as they look down at Jesus. Joseph wears a golden yellow robe over a blue tunic. Joseph, Mary, and Jesus have faint gold halos. Behind them, a brown cow and gray donkey rest on the straw. People closest to Mary and Jesus kneel and bow their heads while the people to the left and right sides mostly stand. Three men kneeling closest to Mary and Jesus offer gifts, including a bronze vessel and a gold jar. One man has long dark brown hair and a beard, and wears a gold crown. Another man is bald with long gray hair and beard, while the third is cleanshaven with shoulder-length brown hair. These men wear robes in powder blue, carnation pink, or celery green with delicate silver and gold embelishments. Others in the crowd range in age from young and cleanshaven to older and bearded. They wear robes and tunics in shades of raspberry pink, butterscotch yellow, lapis blue, plum purple, or forest green. Several horses, their coats white or cinnamon brown, stand among the crowd, a few with riders. To our right, one horse rears its head and two others stand facing each other. Beyond the crowd, grassy green meadows and hills dotted with trees lead back to the horizon. A pale blue sky fills the top third of the composition.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/0fd27212-b70a-4a0b-9e7c-ed0d8bbe7ebf/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The portrait is loosely painted with short strokes and visible dashes in cool, green-edged yellow and blue. The man looks at or toward us from the corners of his electric-blue eyes, which are deep-set under bushy blond eyebrows. He has a bumped nose, high cheekbones, and a narrow chin. A ginger-orange mustache and beard frame his pale pink lips, which are closed. He also has short-cropped blond hair. His face is painted with strokes on mint green and straw yellow, and his features are outlined in plum purple. His high-necked blue smock fastens at his throat over a white garment. The topaz and steel-blue strokes of the smock are overlaid with horizontal, harvest-yellow dashes. The man’s thumb pokes through the rectangular palette he holds in his left hand, closer to us. Daubs of yellow, red, blue, red, and white are smeared on the palette. The edge of the canvas on which the man works angles in from the left edge of the composition. The background is painted thickly with pale celery green.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/1034a430-14b9-494d-8b69-c135e592892f/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

Their bodies are outlined with smoke-gray lines and filled in with paler gray areas, giving the drawing an almost ghostly look against the dark paper. Both children have short hair and rounded, pudgy bodies.  The woman has a subtly rounded figure, a straight nose, and smooth cheeks; her bow lips are closed. Her wavy hair is loosely pulled back and tied at the nape of her neck. Her dress, with a scooped neckline, is cinched at the waist before flaring into a voluminous skirt. She smiles down at the nude baby who stands to our left, looking up at her and leaning against her knees with his weight mostly on his right foot. Her left hand holds his left arm, which reaches across her lap toward a book she presses against her side with her left forearm. His right hand touches her left knee, nearest us, and her right hand passes behind him to caress his shoulders. The second child kneels in a crouch near the woman’s legs, to our right. Leaning on a slender staff like a walking stick, he wears a garland of leaves in his hair and looks up toward the other boy. Chalk strokes and white highlights around his torso suggest he is wrapped in drapery. Some details are difficult to make out because some of the charcoal-gray lines are loosely sketched and retraced. The corners and edges of the paper are chipped, revealing an underlying surface to which it is attached,  and there are crease lines that suggest that the paper was likely folded in the past.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/17e32f68-1927-4829-bade-beb1b968c184/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

Muted, warm browns, sage green, slate blue, and brick red dominate the urban scene, which is loosely painted with short and long dotted brushstrokes so some details are difficult to make out. The street extends diagonally up from our lower left with wide gray sidewalks on either side, which are lined by slender trees sparsely dotted with brown leaves. Dozens of pedestrians meander individually, in pairs, and in small groups on the sidewalks in coats and hats. Across from us, multi-storied buildings with store fronts at street level stretch across the width of the canvas. Rows of windows line the facades. Horse-drawn carriages move in both directions on the street and two omnibuses have pulled to the curb closest to us, where passengers have lined up. Two brick-red, hexagonally shaped kiosks stand opposite each other on either side of the street about halfway along the boulevard. Sunlight filters onto the scene, creating a dappled effect in some areas, especially over to our right. The artist signed and dated the painting in dark green in the lower right corner: “C.Pissarro.97.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/1921981a-82c4-46ee-8cec-185aa18e2538/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

His body and face are angled to our left, and his left eyebrow, closer to us, is slightly cocked while other is low over his other eye. He has a straight nose, a square jaw, and his pink lips are closed. His short, brown hair lays flat against his head but curls around the ear we can see. He wears a pecan-brown vest over a black, long-sleeved shirt with a white, lace-edged collar at the neck. His garments blend into the peanut-brown background so the light falling from the upper left highlights his features and white collar.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/1bd606b9-f58c-4d40-8514-f53c63e37dbd/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The scene is loosely painted with visible brushstrokes. Touches of white, cotton candy-pink, ruby-red, and azure-blue paint in the long grasses close to us could be wildflowers. A few swipes of straw yellow and pale and lapis blue could represent two people, standing and kneeling, in the field close to the fence. The rickety fence starts at the right edge of the canvas and extends into the distance, angling away from us to our left. Rolling hills beyond are a patchwork of emerald green and caramel brown, and are dotted with trees with full, dark green canopies. One brown building sits on the crest of a hill to our right of center. The horizon comes about halfway up this picture, and the turquoise-colored sky is dotted with white puffs of clouds. The artist signed and dated the painting in the lower right corner, “Sisley 75.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/1c2440bb-63a8-434b-8cd9-8307226aa917/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The rectangles are painted, and the abstract shapes are cut from pieces of painted paper. The left column is stacked top to bottom with rectangles in black, lime green, sage green, sunshine yellow, watermelon pink, and amethyst purple. There is also a pink triangle above the pink rectangle, near the middle of the column. Spanning different sections of the column are a blue spiral and a curling blue line, white petal-like shapes, and purple and blue stylized leaves, perhaps seaweed, and triangles. A narrow black form like the profile of a stylized fish and a curve radiating spikes float in the middle of the column. The rectangles of the right column are silvery gray, goldenrod yellow, bright green, lime green, sunshine yellow, and sapphire blue. The column is layered with two more black spiky shapes, a short vertical royal-blue curving line, and an elongated, white U shape. A long, black S-shape floats over the top four rectangles, and a pumpkin-orange spiral lies on top of a sapphire-blue circle near the yellow rectangle at the bottom. That yellow rectangle has blue rectangle at its center and a darker yellow rectangle to the left. There is a white wavy line up the blue area, a black wavy line to each side in the yellow, and one black heart-shape near the each of the lower corners of the blue field. Higher up, the lime-green rectangle in each column also has a smaller, darker green rectangle painted within. The work is set against a flat, parchment-brown background. The artist wrote the title in black cursive letters across bottom, “les betes de la mer...” and signed and dated the lower right, “H. Matisse 50.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/1ca608d9-a02e-4a8a-8a77-f0af60381371/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The man’s hair seems to be flattened against his forehead, and extends beyond his head at the back in a way that suggests it may become a cap or hood. His face turns toward us, and he looks down to our left under arched eyebrows. He has a prominent hooked nose and a brushy mustache. Behind his head, the background is divided into a tomato-red zone for the top half and a golden yellow field below, separated by a thin, pine-green line. Two red and green apples hang from a branch near the upper right corner. The thin yellow halo floats over his head to the left of the branch. A pine-green, stylized, vine-like form curves up from the bottom edge of the panel and ends with flat, sunshine yellow, square shapes, perhaps abstracted flowers or fruit. A hand near the lower right holds one end of the vine like a cigarette between fingertips. The vine seems to turn into a serpent’s head beyond the man’s fingers. Numbers and letters are painted in green in the lower left: “1889” and “P Go.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/1e92536c-e274-4c31-bbe9-cdb6aba6c162/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The table extends off the left edge of the composition and the back, right corner of the table just touches the right edge of the canvas. At the center of the composition, five pieces of marigold-orange fruit with yellow highlights and scarlet-red shading are piled in the dish. The side of the dish to our right is slightly tipped up so the fruit settles near the rim to our left. The dish is painted with loose strokes of sky blue, shell pink, pale yellow, and parchment white. Three more pieces of fruit, including a lemon, sit to our left of the dish and one more piece of fruit sits near the back corner of the table, behind the dish, to our right. Immediately behind the dish is a stemmed glass with a tall, rounded bowl. To our left, between the fruit on the table and in the platter, is a tall, angular, tapering pitcher. The pitcher is painted with emerald and moss-green leaves against a background painted with strokes of light peach, blush pink, slate blue, and one wide stroke of amber orange. The wooden table is peanut brown streaked with strokes of apricot orange and pale sage green. One drawer at the front has a round, wooden pull. There seem to be at least two panels of curtains hanging behind the table. Down the center of the background is a panel of coral peach and saffron orange with a floral pattern painted in wheat brown and denim blue. To our right, the panel is streaked with vertical strokes of teal, midnight, and navy blue. The area to our left, behind the table, could be the panel of a door, painted with pale turquoise. The fruit, dish, vessels, table, curtain, and door are all outlined with cobalt blue.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/2142234c-6ff3-43c7-a026-91c90a0bb86c/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

Filling the lower right quadrant of the composition, the winged woman, Melencolia, sits with her body angled to our left, and she looks in that direction from under furrowed brows. Lit from our right, her face is cast in shadow, but she has a straight nose and her lips are closed. She wears a ring of leaves over hair that falls in waves over her shoulders. Wings curve up from her back, and she wears a long-sleeved dress with a tight bodice and a voluminous, pleated skirt. She rests her chin on one tightly closed fist. The other arm rests on a book in her lap, and she holds one of the two legs of a tall compass in that hand. Several keys hang on a ribbon looped onto her belt, and they nestle into the deep folds of her skirt. Around her feet are a purse cinched closed, several nails, the metal tip of a bellows, a saw, a plane, the end of a pair of pincers, an ink pot, a molder’s form for baseboards, and a round sphere about the size of a basketball. The dog lies in a tight circle to our left of Melencolia’s feet, its chin resting across its paws. The dog’s ribs show through the short fur of its hide. Next to the dog, the millstone leans against the building that fills the right half of the composition. The millstone is round and flat, is about the height of the woman's torso, and a hole is cut from its center. A chubby child sits atop the stone. It has short, curly hair, stubby wings, a loose robe, and it draws on a tablet propped on its lap. Beyond the child, a wooden ladder leans against the building, and a pair of scales hangs above his head. On the face of the building, hanging over Melencolia’s head, is an hourglass with the sand about halfway spent and a magic square, which is a grid of four rows and four columns. The numbers in the grid read, from left to right, 16, 3, 2, 13 in the top row; an upside down 5, a 10, 11, and 8 in the second row; a backward 9, a 6, 7, and 12 in the third row; and a 4, 15, 14, and 1 in the bottom row. A bell hangs from a ring above this grid. On the step beyond the sleeping dog and millstone, another large stone is carved into flat planes to create an irregular, geometric, rhomboid form about as tall as the millstone. A hammer lies in front of the rhomboid, and beyond it is a melting pot sitting among tongues of flame in a mug-like cup. In the upper left quadrant of the composition, a placid body of water leads back to a distant town and small boats, beneath a starburst that fills the sky. An arched rainbow crosses the sky over a rat-like bat with its sharp teeth and tongue showing. It holds a banner reading “MELENCOLIA I.” The artist signed and dated the engraving as if he had carved into the front face of the step on which Melencolia sits, near the lower right corner: “1514 AD,” with the uppercase D nestled between the long legs of the wide, uppercase A.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/217d0dc0-62f1-4caa-9d24-943ff941e9d6/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The ballerinas’ white costumes have off-the-shoulder bodices and knee-length tutus. Black ribbons encircle their necks and wrists, and their tights and slippers are bright, carnation pink. Pink and white flowers adorn their hair and dresses. The man in black is balding and has a dark goatee. He stands next to the dancer closest to us. Three dancers on his far side seem to stand casually in the wings of the stage, their feet outturned. The final dancer, farther from us, is bright in the stage lights. The floor is ash-gray, and the backdrop is drawn loosely with visible strokes in pine green, ochre yellow, lapis and ice blue. A narrow margin lines the edges of the tan paper. The artist signed the lower left corner, “Degas.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/2303ecb9-b192-4833-8d33-29c0ccb7a07f/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

This was created with loose, visible brushstrokes so some details are difficult to make out. The four peonies clustered to our right are painted with textured strokes of cream white and pale butter yellow. The two red flowers to our left are similarly painted with long, parallel strokes. The leaves are painted with moss and sage green, with vivid royal blue for the shadows. The pitcher has a wide mouth over only slightly pinched neck, and a handle is situated to our right. Cobalt-blue, widely spaced, vertical stripes are flanked by fawn-brown zigzagging lines. The tabletop is painted as a field of brown, separated from the background with a line of navy blue. The background is made with long strokes in aqua, light blue, and celery green that curve around the flowers in the upper right corner.

All the people are light skinned and have brown or dark hair. The brushwork throughout is loose and details are indistinct. The brightest object in the room, the light, has a flaring shade over a spherical body, and hangs from three curling, scrolling arms. Painted in butter and golden yellow, it seems to be made from brass. The table is bare except for a white teapot and two small, white teacups on saucers near the women who sit to our right. The women have turned their wooden chairs to face each other next to the table, so the one closer to us sits with her back to us. Both have brown hair pulled up in buns, and they look down at their hands. The woman farther away wears a pine-green dress with white trim at the cuffs, and the one facing away from us wears a slate-blue, high-necked dress with a white collar. The one who faces us wears holds something white in her hands, presumably needlework. A third chair at the table, closest to us, is turned toward the women, but is empty. The man stands in semi-darkness behind the two women next to a glowing fireplace. He has a full beard and wears a black suit. He leans on the mantel with his left arm, on our right, with his other hand on his hip. Though his eyes are deeply shaded, he seems to look down at the woman in the blue-gray dress. A large mirror over the fireplace reflects the heads of the man and the woman facing us, as well as the back of a blue-gray lidded vase on the mantel and a clock hanging on the opposite wall, out of our view. A curtain runs along the wall beyond the fireplace and is painted with the suggestion of a floral pattern in strokes of forest green, burnt orange, gray, and tan. The rest of the room is swallowed in shadowy areas of dusky browns, grays, and tans. The artist signed the work in red letters in the lower left corner: “Claude Monet.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/23a7bb39-d6da-4cf4-8961-7e743fd39aba/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The artist has added strokes in pastel in some areas, as for the dancers’ pink tights and pointed toe shoes. The whole scene is loosely rendered, either with pastel or in the monotype print on which the artist drew. There are at least three ballerinas lined up in a row moving away from us, along the left edge of the paper. Their dark hair is pulled up and, for the woman farthest from us, two pink flowers adorn her hair. They wear costumes with silvery-white bodices and flaring, knee-length tutus. An area streaked with pine green and brown in the upper left corner could be a curtain behind the dancers, and people wearing black watch from red box seats across the stage from us. The surface of the stage itself is a blend of charcoal gray and rose pink, and the edge is lined with white to our right. The audience is a made up of a few peach dots within strokes and smudges of black. More gold and brick-red box seats fill the wall opposite us. There is a black silhouette along the right edge of the paper, with a bulge near the bottom right corner perhaps indicating the shoulder of an onlooker from the wings, next to us. The artist signed the work with vibrant blue near the lower right corner, “degas.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/24be36d2-79bc-4c04-8c61-4067ae462894/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The surface of the canvas is crisscrossed by an irregular grid of black lines running vertically and horizontally like offset ladders. The black lines create squares and rectangles of different sizes, and the width of the lines vary slightly. One complete square sits at the center of the composition and is painted white. Other rectangles are incomplete, their corners sliced by the edge of the canvas, and each is a different shade of white with hints of pale blue and gray. The black grid creates triangular forms where it meets the angled edge of the canvas in some places, and some of these are filled with flat areas of color. A tomato-red triangle is placed to the left of the top center point, and a vibrant yellow triangle is to the left of the lower center point. A black triangle is next to it at the bottom center, and a cobalt-blue triangle is situated just below the right point. The painting is signed with the artist’s initials at the lower center: “PM.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/262b6aad-9869-45af-b33c-d3d41964203a/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

To the right of center, a nude woman stands on a patch of violet-colored ground with both arms overhead, as she looks up. To our left, two women wearing only pale blue cloths around their waists sit side-by-side on a patch of amethyst-purple ground. Both sit with their bodies angled to our right, and they look toward the ground with their arms across their chests. To our right of the standing woman, the final pair of women stand or walk toward the right edge of the painting. The woman to our left in that pair wears a dusky rose-pink dress and a bright, coral-pink head covering. She holds one arm across her chest, elbow bent. Next to her, the fifth woman is bare-chested with a white cloth tied around her waist, covering her legs. She looks to our right and holds up her arm, which extends off the right edge of the composition. The purple patches on the ground are surrounded by other areas of raspberry pink and mauve. A band of trees and vegetation stretches across the background, leading back to cobalt-blue mountains along the horizon. Mountains to each side of the composition brush the top edge, and the shallow U of sky between them is ivory white. The artist signed and dated the painting in the lower right corner, “Paul Gauguin 1903.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/27b6ca51-b402-483f-9339-27ee2a10d500/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The woman’s body is angled slightly to our right but she looks at us with dark eyes under faint, arched brows. Her nose is rounded, her cheeks smooth and flushed, and her pale pink lips are closed. Her face is framed in a cloud of nickel-gray hair, and tendrils curl down over her shoulders. She wears a wide-brimmed straw hat with a white ribbon set on the back of her head and slightly off to one side. The bodice of her dress has a low, curving neck. This area is loosely painted to create the impression of layers of lace. A band of intertwined pale pink roses and delicate green leaves borders the outer edge of the lace. The dress has long, tight sleeves with lace at the cuffs and the notably narrow waist is tied with a blush-pink ribbon. The full, silver skirt is picked up to create a row of puffs, like the top of a muffin, around her knees. Bunches of pink roses and white ribbons are nestled into the puffs, and below, the skirt falls in long, vertical pleats to her ankles. She wears white stockings and pointed, petal-pink shoes. In her left arm, on our right, she holds a closed fan loosely at her side, almost lost behind the skirt. She holds a pink carnation with a full bloom and a bud on a long, curving stem in her other hand, by her hip. A caramel-brown pug with a black face, wearing a pink collar lined with three bells, stands facing us with one front paw lifted, to our right of the woman's feet. The landscape is painted in tones of mint and sage green for grass beneath trees enclosing the space the woman stands in, sand brown for the ground, and icy blue for the sky above.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/299ddaef-0a69-4a23-96dc-71d7f1ee6112/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

They both have pale skin and thin, gold halos floating above their heads. The clear sky behind them deepens from teal blue along the top edge to ice blue behind their shoulders. To our right, the woman is shown from the lap up with her body angled to our left, toward the child she holds. She looks down at the child almost in profile with dark eyes under faint brows. She has a long, straight nose, smooth cheeks, and her petal-pink lips are closed. Her blond hair is braided and twisted back from her face under a sheer, gold-trimmed, white veil, that flutters as if in a breeze. Her rose-pink dress has a wide neckline and the elbow-length sleeve we can see falls loosely over a tighter, spring-green sleeve. The neckline is trimmed with gold decorations and an inscription: “MDVIII.R.V.PIN.” A peacock-blue robe drapes over the shoulder farther from us and across her lap. That arm wraps around the child’s back, and she holds her other hand to her chest, near where the child grips the neckline of her dress. The child sits on a white pillow with one leg flung across the woman’s lap and the other, closer to us, dangling between her knees. Slightly slouched, his body is angled to our right, toward the woman, but he looks over his shoulder at us with dark eyes. He has faint eyebrows, a delicate nose, a dimpled chin, flushed cheeks, and his pale pink lips curl into a smile. He has wispy blond hair and pudgy, toddler-like cheeks and body. His other hand rests on the pillow between his legs. A band of gauzy, sheer fabric decorated with gold stripes wraps around one shoulder and around his upper chest.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/2ac0a514-b560-4a49-b533-9b4951d5bf2c/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

Closest to us and along the bottom edge of the composition, a table or shelf is spread with several books, some upright, some on their sides, and one thick tome laid open. The open book has writing on the pages, but the words are not legible. Beyond the books, the man is shown from the waist up with his body angled to our left. A few curls peek out from the soft, rounded cap that covers his head down to his neck and his forehead, and nearly reaches the top edge of the paper. His face and jowls are deeply lined, and he has deep-set eyes, a long, sloped nose, and his lips are closed. His robe rides high on his shoulders and around his neck, parting at the throat to show a high-collared garment beneath. He gazes down at his hands, which rest on the paper on which he writes. One thick-fingered hand holds the inkwell and the other the pen. The paper and a book underneath it rest on a lectern that angles up toward the writer. The lectern sits on a desk that also holds a short urn with a small bunch of leaves and flowers at the front corner closest to us. Two packets or pieces of folded paper sit next to the lectern.  Densely spaced, fine lines create dark shadows in the deep folds of the man’s garments and on the wall behind him. A panel on the wall behind the man reads, in Latin, “IMAGO ERASMI ROTERODA MI AB ALBERTO DVRERO AD VIVAM EFFIGIEM DELINIATA,” which is followed by a Greek inscription, and then, “MDXXXVI.” The artist signed the work with his monogram, consisting of an upper case D straddled by the legs of a wide, upper case A at the bottom center of the panel.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/2cd6b88f-9bcf-488b-a305-8717eae8cba5/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The peanut-brown building to our left nearly reaches the top edge of the canvas. It has three oversized, tall stories under a high, sloping roof with a slender chimney. A promenade with carriages runs in front of the tall building. In the plaza closer to us but tiny in scale, people gather in small and large groups, along the bottom edge of the composition. They are painted with dabs and short strokes of cobalt blue, butter and golden yellow, brick red, black, and white. The trees create a diagonal line running from the lower right corner into the scene, along the edge of the plaza to our right. Beyond the plaza and trees, the corners of a formal garden with sand-white walking paths stretch back to the row of buildings in the distance, which come halfway up the painting. That long line of buildings is painted with tones of light brown with rows of tall, narrow windows. The roofs are slate gray, and several cupolas and towers are spaced along its length. The buildings span the width of the painting and disappear behind the tall building to our left. Loosely painted, white, puffy clouds float across the ice-blue sky above. The artist signed and dated the work with brown paint in the lower left corner: “C. Pissarro. 1900.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/2f61c3b8-00ff-41d4-941a-9d639c291472/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The scene is loosely painted with visible brushstrokes throughout. A muted blue shadow cuts across the flax-yellow ground close to us from our left. About a dozen golden-brown haystacks extend from the center of the composition off into the distance to our right. The people stand in the harvested field to our left. Tiny in scale, the woman wears a rose-pink dress and white apron and cap. She bends over as the man stands nearby, resting a scythe against one shoulder.

His shirt has a wide, golden yellow stripe along the collar above indigo blue, under a grayish-violet purple jacket. The wall over his shoulder, in the upper left corner, is painted vivid lime green with long, vertical brushstrokes. The view through the window beyond his other shoulder is of vegetation and mountains. The portrait is painted with visible brushstrokes throughout, and is especially loose in the background, hair, and jacket.

Closest to us, the hills create a shallow V that spans the lower third of the composition, with the right-hand hill rising to more than halfway up the right edge. The hills are painted with dashes and long strokes mostly in seafoam, shamrock, and celery green, with some swipes of peach, goldenrod yellow, and royal blue. On the hill to our left, one woman sits and the other stands next to her. They wear hats, long-sleeved, fitted jackets, and long skirts in tones of dusky pink and dove gray. A touch of peach on the seated woman, to our left, gives the impression of a pale face. A red veil or scarf at the back of the other woman’s hat is lifted, as if in the wind. The water is painted with blended strokes of pale blue, light turquoise, smoky mauve pink, and touches of soft peach. The horizon comes two-thirds of the way up the composition, and the sky is painted with the same tones of blue, green, and peach to suggest a screen of clouds. Triangles and dashes of slate blue suggest about three dozen sailboats, rowboats, and one steamship in the rippling water. Squiggles of teal and sage green create reflections for some of the boats. The brushstrokes are visible throughout. In some areas, the paint is so thinly applied that the texture of the canvas shows through, especially in the sky. The artist signed the work in the lower left corner: “Claude Monet 82.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/31a2c319-1d47-4119-82c1-dbe8f9ed2e58/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The cliff face is painted with dabs and textured strokes of slate gray, peachy tan, and muted blue, and some moss grows along crevices to our left. The opening to our left of center is four times the size of the smaller opening next to it. Murky green water reflects the shadowy openings and the pier-like stone between them. The water churns white over large boulders to our right, in the lower corner of the canvas. A pale-skinned man, miniscule in scale in front of the larger opening, stands barefoot with his back to us. His pants are rolled up over his knees and the long shirt sleeves up to the elbow under a vest. One hand is raised to hold a long stick. He is on what might be a pier stretching across the water.

Her body is supported by a metal rod that connects the base to her right hip, to our left. Her hair seems to be pulled up and her facial features are indistinct. She steps forward onto her right foot, on our left in this photograph, so that the toes of her other foot touch the pool of wax on the base behind her. She lifts her right arm, on our left, in front of her so her upper arm is parallel to the base, and seems to look toward that hand. Her other arm is held away and slightly behind her body. Light reflects off some areas of the wax, which are smooth, while other areas are rough.

The chalky, rugged faces of the cliffs are dappled and streaked with olive green, dark brown, gray, rust red, and mustard yellow. The horizon comes a third of the way up the composition so the cliffs are outlined against the powder-blue sky, which is loosely veiled with wispy, cream-white clouds. The mossy tops of the cliffs are illuminated by sunlight from the upper left, and a solitary leafy tree leans into view between the two cliff-tops closest to us. Four empty, wooden boats sit on the flat, sandy beach below. We look onto the long sides of the two closest to us. One is stripped and appears dilapidated, while the one behind it has a ginger-brown sail attached to the mast in the prow. Two more wooden poles or oars jut out from the cockpit on either side of the mast. A small flag with horizontal bands of blue, white, and red flies from a short pole near the middle of the boat. A bundle the same color as the unfurled sail sits in the boat. Another sail is spread out on the sand to our right, and coiled ropes lie nearby. The two other boats are slightly further back on the right, with one angled to our left while we view the other straight on. There are two people a short distance beyond these boats. One faces our left in profile while the other sits on the sand looking toward the water. Thin trails of white delineate the low surf and a few sailboats drift by on the brilliant blue water. The artist signed the lower left, “G. Courbet.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/388d34c4-2515-480f-8184-424ed1a758a7/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The fence cuts across the space closer to us, and the snowy field beyond reflects the cool blues of the sky.

Most of the men wear voluminous, knee-length togas wrapped in short robes in shades of white, topaz blue, grass green, coral orange, or rose pink. Most of the women wear long, dress-like garments in tones of shell pink, apricot orange, or lapis blue over white sleeves. For all but one woman, their garments have fallen off one shoulder to reveal a round, firm breast. Several objects are strewn on the rocky, dirt ground in front of the group, including a wide, wooden bucket with a piece of paper affixed to its front to our right, a glass goblet, a pitchfork, a large blue and white ceramic dish filled with grapes and small yellow fruits, and an overturned cup near the center. Cliff-like, craggy rocks rise steeply behind the group to our left, filling much of the sky opposite a tall grove of leafy, dark green trees to our right.

A winged child holds a dove near his face to our left, and two dogs stand to our right of the pair. The woman sits facing away from us, twisting to our right. Her knees are bent with one knee raised as she leans back on her seat and turns to wrap her arms around the man’s chest. Her flushed face looks up toward the man. She has pale skin, and her blond hair is braided and coiled on the back of her head. A sheer white cloth drapes from her left shoulder, along the left side of her body, and over that knee. Her seat is covered with an orchid-pink cloth. The man strides to our right with his shoulders angled in that direction. He turns his head to look at the woman under lowered lids. He has short, curly brown hair, and his pink lips are parted. He wears a steel-blue toga tied in place with a gold band over one shoulder. A horn is tied around his waist with a gold sash. He wears a shin-high, laced sandal on the leg we can see. The arm closer to the woman is held high, that hand gripping a tall staff. He holds the leashes of the two dogs with his other hand, by his side. A pink band is tied around that upper arm. One bronze-brown dog stands facing our right in profile, while the other, closer to us, has a white body and a brown head, which hangs down as it looks to our left. Both dogs have floppy ears, and their mouths are open with their pink tongues hanging out. In the shadows just beyond the woman’s back knee, the winged baby hunches his shoulders while holding the white dove to his cheek. The cherub has short, blond hair, rounded, flushed cheeks, and small white wings. The elbow closer to us rests on a ledge or tree branch. A tree grows up next to the cherub, reaching off the top edge of the painting. A hill rises to our right in the distance, and a rainbow arcs against a pale blue sky screened with parchment-white clouds. A bright white flash in the upper right corner illuminates the trees beneath it.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/3ac12dea-a484-485d-9fc2-0b4a6841515b/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The objects are made up of areas of mostly flat color and many are outlined in black, creating the impression that the some shapes are two-dimensional and assembled almost like a collage. The brown table has an oval top and a curving pedestal foot. At the center of the jumble on the tabletop, a guitar lies on its side with the neck facing us and reaching to our right. Beneath the black fretboard and neck, the curving form of the guitar is painted tomato red. The upper half is represented by a squared-off brown form. The guitar seems to rest atop or in front of an array of stacked shapes, like splayed pieces of paper, in white, lavender purple, and pale blue. A curving form painted in turquoise to our left seems to be a vase holding a spray of three flowers. The vase is shown against a white square painted with horizontal black lines, like sheet music. A dark gray form at the middle of the table, beneath the guitar, could be the silhouette of a bird facing our left. Just to the right of the bird, a pair of playing cards lie on a blue area. Painted in turquoise against gray, one card has six dots and the other one club. A chair with a curved, arching top and a gray upholstered seat is pulled up to the table to our right. The front left leg is light gray with turned knobs near the foot and halfway up the leg; the right leg is painted black, as if in shadow. Panels of pale tan suggest wainscotting behind the table beneath a pale gray wall across the background. The overall impression of the painting is fragmented as even single objects seem to be broken up into planes and areas of color. The artist signed and underlined his name with red paint in the lower left corner: “Picasso.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/3cbe6c4a-79c1-479a-b0d3-3ac903c96310/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The grass and plants in the field closest to us are suggested by tightly packed clusters of parallel, short, vertical strokes and curlicues. Just beyond it is a gap, suggesting a road, and another field made up of rows of short strokes angled slight to the left or right that recede toward the man and buildings. Two twisted trees, each with a gnarled trunk and spiky branches, stands to our left and right where the more distant fields meet the road, near the sides of the paper. The trees reach high into the blank sky above them. Farther back and to our left, the man and horse are drawn with only a few strokes each, shown facing our right in profile. Beyond them, vertical lines of varying heights, with some intersected by horizontal lines, separate the field from the farmhouses. We see the top level of the three loosely drawn buildings along the horizon line, which comes just under halfway up the composition. The largest is a long rectangular structure just right of center with a few windows scattered across its facade. To the left, beyond the horse and ploughman, is a smaller square structure with a peaked roof. On the far left, the third building has two dots suggesting windows. More thin, vertical strokes appear beyond the buildings, and a low bank of puffy clouds hovers just above the horizon on the right side. Some outlines in graphite are visible under or near the ink lines.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/3e0d3b1a-2e12-42ad-9150-423ac11549c5/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The fish lies on its side with its belly facing us, and one bulging eye peers off to our right. A man wearing a helmet holds a knife twice his own size with the blade up as he cuts the fish’s belly. Fish and scallop shells of all sizes tumble from its cavernous mouth and side. Several fish also have smaller fish in their mouths. On the far side of the fish, a man stands on a ladder braced against the enormous creature, holding a raised trident as he looks down, his face covered by the wide brim of his hat. On the land to our left is another smaller fish with human legs, which carries a fish in its mouth. It passes a man who carries a fish on his back outside a dilapidated cottage as he climbs a ladder leaning against a tree. Two other fish hang from the tree’s branches. Around the shoreline to the right, fish surface with more fish in their mouths. A man and a boy wearing tunics and long headdresses sit in a rowboat close to us, pointing as a second man in the boat holds a knife in his teeth and pulls a small fish from the body of a larger one. Another man sits on the beach further up the shoreline, about to catch a fish using fish as bait. The water stretches back to a town in the far distance. Boats float in the middle distance and some approach another whale-sized fish beached on a small island behind a tall rocky outcropping. About a dozen people with spears gather on the island around that fish. A flock of birds fly in silhouette in the distance beyond the island. A flying creature closer to us has a scaly body, gaping mouth, wavy tail, and tear-drop shaped wings. The print is inscribed in the lower left, “Hieronijmus.Bos. inuentor” and in the lower center, “ECCE.” The lower right is inscribed, “COCK.

Her small rose pink, pursed lips are slightly darker than the faint blush on her cheeks. Her jet-black, long-sleeved dress has a high waist and a wide, diaphanous gray collar at the rounded neckline. Her left elbow, on our right, drapes over the top of the spindles making up the back of the chair so her hand rests near the gray collar. Her other arm rests by her side.

The man’s body is angled to our right, but he looks at us from the corners of his dark eyes. He has bushy gray brows, a bumped nose, high cheekbones, and his lips are closed. He has short white hair around a receding hairline, and his beard falls to his chest. His pewter-gray armor gleams darkly with cream-white accents. With one hand, he braces a baton against his right hip, to our left, and with the other gathers the folds of his cloak down by that side. The cloak is tied over one shoulder and falls heavily around his body. His helmet rests on a shoulder-high gray stone structure, perhaps a mantle or a ledge, behind the man to our right. The rest of the background is charcoal gray.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/41d63b2f-972c-4ed9-9c28-b3d8b3d260d5/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

She stands just to our right of center with her elbows bent, perhaps to clasp her hands in front of her. Her head is turned slightly toward us so we see the line of her forehead, nose, and chin almost in profile facing our left. Her auburn hair seems to be pulled up under a black hat that sits on the back of her head. Her high-necked, charcoal-gray vest-like bodice has a line of white at the neck, suggesting lace or an undershirt. The bodice covers a black shirt with ruffles that fall at least to her elbows, and the long dress drapes close along the contours of her legs. She looks to the far wall, which is painted with sketchy, visible brushstrokes in marigold orange, lemon-lime green, brown, black, and pale yellow to create the impression of paintings in gold frames.

The left half is a collection of mostly vertical lines above a nest-like patch of crossing lines near the bottom. Many of the vertical lines are spaced apart so only a few overlap, and the lines are marked with splotches that resemble ink blots. To our right, more densely spaced spatters and lightly curving lines combine to create an abstracted face and body of a person. The artist signed and dated the work in black paint in the lower right corner: “Jackson Pollock 51.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/451d67ee-01d2-4a45-bd51-31447a034618/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The scene and dancers are loosely painted so many features are indistinct. All the women have light skin and dark brown hair. Each pale, robins’ egg-blue costume has a low-cut, tightly fitting, sleeveless bodice and a full skirt. Dabs of off white, teal, and blue suggest flowers lining the deep U of the neckline at the front and down the back of each bodice. Closest to us and nearly brushing the edges of the lower right corner of the canvas, one dancer sits on the end of a wooden bench and leans down between her legs, her feet widely planted. She rests her torso on an elbow folded onto one knee as she reaches for her left foot, farther from us, with her other hand. Her hair is pulled up and her face, looking downward, is deep in shadow. Sitting behind her on the bench, to our left, a second dancer lifts her right leg, toe pointing, as she pulls on her pale pink tights. Her other leg stretches straight, pointed toe brushing the floor, in front of her. This woman’s hair hangs loose around her shoulders. The pair is brightly lit from a source to our right, and an arched area of electric blue and mustard yellow behind them is difficult to interpret. The floor, which takes up about two-thirds of the composition, is painted with dabs of teal blue, pale fuchsia pink, and caramel brown. It leads us back to the upper left corner of the painting where four more four ballerinas stand in a line. The pair to our left stands with their backs to us, facing the wall with their right legs raised to shoulder height, toes pointed. The pair to our right faces us. They also stand with their right legs raised, creating a wide angle with their standing legs. All four ballerinas bend their arms gently at the elbow, and some tip their heads toward the raised legs. The rightmost dancer is illuminated by a pair of French doors at the back corner, at the top center of the painting. The wall behind the bench is streaked with mint green over honey brown, and the wall at the back of the room is leather brown. The visible, soft brushstrokes give the image a blurred, ethereal appearance in the dimmed studio.

To our left, the angel has long, blond, curly hair, smooth skin, and is smiling. The wings are outlined in royal blue, and they blend from blue to green to yellow to crimson. The angel holds one hand, closer to us, up at chest height with the index finger subtly pointing upward. Holding a long scepter in the other hand, the angel angles their body toward the woman to our right. The angel wears a gold jewel and pearl-encrusted crown and a jeweled long, voluminous robe in scarlet-red and shimmering gold brocade. The neck and along the opening down the front are lined with pearls and jewels. The angel looks toward the woman, who wears a royal-blue dress tied with a red belt at the high waist. Her long brown hair is tied back but one tendril falls over her left shoulder, to our right. She kneels facing us with her raised hands facing outward. Her head is tipped a bit to our left, and she looks up and into the distance to our right with lips slightly parted. She kneels behind a book lying open on a low table. A vase of white lilies and a red cushion lies on the floor in front of the table, close to us. The floor is decorated with people and scenes outlined in black and set into square panels, as if inlaid with wood. The church behind and above the people has a row of tall, narrow arches with bull’s-eye glass windows. A walkway lined with columns runs above the arches, and sunlight comes in through arched windows under the flat wood ceiling. A white dove flies toward the woman on gold lines from a window at the upper left of the painting. Latin words painted in gold capital letters are exchanged between the people. The angel says, “AVE GRA PLENA.” The letters of the woman’s response are painted upside down and backward: “ECCE ANCILLA DNI.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/46633bd6-4834-40fb-8ce0-fb975c731dc1/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

On our left, a pale young man in a white tunic looks with eyes wide and lips parted at a group of three people on our right. The young man's right hand, on our left, is raised to stroke the head of a reddish-brown horse at his right shoulder. He stands with feet planted wide, knees bent, and he curls his left hand into a fist. Behind him, a man holds up a fluttering, light blue cape. A mottled red wall forms a backdrop to this scene on our left. The tight group gathered under a tree on our right stares back at the young man. The trio is made up of a balding, older man, a light-skinned boy also wearing a white tunic, and, closest to us, a brown-skinned woman wearing a marigold-orange shirt and a maroon-red skirt. Behind this group, a pair of pale raised arms suggests a fourth person, but the head is missing or has been painted over. The ground under the people is saffron orange. In the center of the picture, beyond the people, a group of horses stands near a green bank by a river, its surface reflecting white. The far bank is lined with white buildings. Tan and olive-green slopes rise from the opposite riverbank under a pale blue sky with cream-white clouds sweeping along the top edge of the composition.

Her body and face are angled to our left but she looks out at us from the corners of her eyes. She has dark brown eyes under curving brows, a straight nose, smooth cheeks, and her coral-red, heart-shaped lips are closed. A crown of parchment-white and rust-orange flowers with sage-green and brown leaves sits akimbo, close to the ear we can see, over her honey-brown hair, which falls over her shoulders and down her back to her waist. Teardrop-shaped pearls hang from her ears. She wears a sea-green gown with elbow-length sleeves over an eggshell-white garment, which has voluminous sleeves edged with gold. The green garment is lined with pearls, jewels, and gold embroidery around the hem of the sleeves and down the front. The muted red apple rests in one hand, which is cupped in her other hand at her waist. The woman is lit from our left in a warm glow against the brown background.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/4b6a997d-410c-44af-a3f1-95ac4f103717/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

Both boys have light skin with a yellow cast, and their bodies are outlined with delicate brown lines. They both have short-cropped brown hair, and their facial features are sketched in with brown paint. To our left, the boy sitting on the box looks down at his right foot, on our left, which he holds up on the box with both hands. Next to him, the second boy stands with his arms down by his sides and he looks off into the distance to our right. The room is undefined but has a pale, rust-red floor. Behind them, a terracotta-red urn and jug sit on a platform, possibly in a niche in the silvery-gray wall. Brushstrokes are visible throughout.

Brushstrokes are visible in some areas, especially in the clothing and sky seen through one arch. All the men have light skin with a greenish cast while the women and children have smooth, pale skin. They wear dresses and robes in shades of rose pink, lapis blue, emerald green, or brown. The man at the center, Jesus, stands facing us with his right knee bent and his weight shifted onto his other leg. He holds a short, four-tailed whip in his right hand high and stretched across his body. He tilts his head to our left and looks down in that direction at the person next to him. Jesus has brown hair and wears a dark pink robe under a bright blue cloth that drapes over one shoulder and across the other hip. To our left, two men with bare torsos and raised arms lean away from Jesus. The man closest to him faces away from us as he bends over at the waist and looks over his shoulder at Jesus. That man wears a burnt orange cloth wrapped around his hips over a dark brown skirt, perhaps of a toga. Behind this pair are about a dozen other people and below them, two bare-breasted women recline on steps, their bodies angled to our right. One woman throws her head back against her raised arm, her mouth open and brow gathered. The other woman looks up at Jesus, holding one hand to her bare breast, her lips closed. She rests her right hand, to our left, on a cage holding five white birds on the ground next to her. Next to Jesus, on our right, a wrinkled, balding, gray-haired and bearded man sits on the steps so his knees come toward us. His torso twists to our left so he can rest his chin in his hand as he looks up at Jesus. That elbow and his other hand rest on the handle of a basket filled with gold coins. There are several animals around this man, including two black and white rabbits at his feet, nosing silver objects spilling from a pouch. Nearby, a gray bird sits on the step, and a white lamb with its feet tied to a stick lies belly up next to a wooden box. Behind the man is a crowd of at least eight people, looking at Jesus or each other. A bare-breasted woman guides a naked, toddler-aged child away from this group. A stick balanced across the woman’s far shoulder has a chicken hanging from the front end and a basket hanging behind. Another child lies back on the steps near the right edge of the painting. Next to that child, an open book and a loaf of bread lie beneath a table covered with an orange and brown patterned cloth. The scene takes place in a structure with columns and arched openings. Two people wearing blue robes hustle under one arched opening to our right, which leads back to a shadowed space lit with a chandelier. Blue sky and gray and white clouds are visible through the arch over Jesus, where there are also more sand-brown buildings in the distance. There are statues high up on ledges on either side of that opening. The artist signed the work in white paint in the lower left to the right of the bird cage in Greek letters.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/4c437ce8-3ca8-42e9-af5b-6331afcee1d0/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The cross and the band of wavy lines at its base nearly fill this canvas. Each end of the horizontal line of the cross ends with a black disk. Three crimson-red lines emanate like rays from the sides of each disk. The top of the vertical line of the cross ends with a scarlet-red form that flares into a straight line across the bottom and curves up and over, to our left. That shape is outlined in red and partially filled in with the same color at the curving end. At the bottom of the cross, seven vertical wavy lines are spaced along a horizontal line, all in maroon red. A turquoise-blue star floats over the black disk to our right, and three curved lines in blue, yellow, and red arch in a short, stylized rainbow near the upper right of the painting. The background is mottled with tan and ochre yellow, and speckled with topaz-blue dots mostly in the upper left and the lower right corners. The artist signed and dated the work in tiny letters near the lower right: “Miró 1924.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/4ce3a582-bbd3-43ff-bd7e-ec3d71bd6444/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

Near us, facing our right in profile, the brown horse rests his head across the back of the white horse, who stands with its tail toward us. The horses stand along the ridge of a grassy hill that dips beyond us to a waterway crossing the width of the canvas. Several buildings line the shore closer to us. At least one building has parchment-white walls and a red roof, and another has peanut-brown walls with a darker, chocolate-brown roof. More rooflines are nestled between, and gray smoke wafts from several chimneys. Long, low boats float near the opposite shore. The land rises in a hill across the water with more horses or other animals in the far pastures. The scene is loosely painted, and the background is the most indistinct, so some details are difficult to make out. Touches of brown and green suggest trees and perhaps more trees and buildings along the hill in the distance. The ivory-white sky is touched with pale, petal pink and a hint of blue near the horizon.

The body of the woman to our left is angled to our left with her hands raised, presumably about to plunge into the teal-colored water. The woman to our right unwraps a cloth patterned with bright yellow flowers on a deep purple background from her waist. Between the women and farther away, a bare-chested man, also with brown skin, wears a tomato-red garment across his hips as he stands hip-deep in the water holding a long spear. The top of his head is cropped by the top edge of the painting. Along the left edge of the canvas, a gnarled tree is painted as a flat field of dark, charcoal gray, and it rises off the side and top of the composition. An area of the same color, perhaps a thick root or the trunk growing nearly horizontally, spans the width of the painting, separating the women from us. The area around the trunk to our left and right is painted with fields of evergreen and cool mint. Closer to us, along the front of the root, a field of rosy pink swirls with grape purple to suggest sand. This area is dotted with harvest-yellow and pumpkin-orange vines and stylized flowers. A bunch of vivid orange flowers with pine and spring-green leaves sits on the root near the trunk, to our left. Most of the painting, especially the landscape, is painted with areas of mostly flat color. In the bottom left corner, the artist has written the title of the painting in darkred paint: “Fatata te Miki.” In the lower right corner, he signed and dated the work with periwinkle blue: “P. Gauguin 92.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/4f9268d4-c250-4dd8-9bee-d08d8942b8d1/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The jockeys and horses’ features are especially freely painted so much of the detail is indistinct. The horses are all chestnut brown except for two at the middle, which are dark brown. One horse, second from our right, rears up on its hind legs, and one to our left nuzzles its neighbor. The riders all wear brimmed caps or helmets, white pants, and knee-high black boots. Their caps and high-necked shirts are painted in shades of goldenrod yellow, aquamarine blue, white, red, or peach. Their faces and hands are peach-colored or light brown. Some of the horses and the rider’s clothing are outlined in black. One of the riders is set a little farther back than the others. A black silhouette in the near distance to our right suggests a man wearing a suit and tall top hat. Swipes of black, brown, sky blue, and white create the impression of a crowd across from us, gathered on the far side of the grassy area. Light green fields continue back to a line of shamrock-green trees at the foot of gently sloping hills. White clouds screen the ice-blue sky above, which takes up the top quarter of the painting. The paint seems thinly applied in many areas, especially the horses and the grassy fields, so the weave of the canvas is visible under strokes of green and brown. The artist signed the lower right corner, “Degas.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/5044a30b-b86e-4c12-9178-7aedaadb36e6/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

Its front legs rear up and its head turned so we see it in profile. The rider braces against the stirrup we can see and plunges a spear into a serpentine dragon to our lower left. Some areas are defined with cream-white or charcoal-gray lines. For instance, white lines shape the rider’s clothing and delineate where the underside of the horse stands out against the background. The horse’s eyes, nose, and parted mouth are drawn in with gray.

The scene is created with long, visible brushstrokes of vivid color. Closest to us, the field is painted with vertical strokes of golden yellow and pea green. Touches of cardinal red and slashes of pine green create flowers around the end of the stone wall, which curves toward us from the background, at the center of this painting. The wall is painted with horizontal dashes of lilac and lavender purple, salmon pink, and periwinkle blue. A person wearing peach-colored trousers, a peacock-blue shirt, and a dark hat walks away from us, into the field, to our left of the wall. The white road enters the scene from the right, and meets the stone wall and a second wall on the far side of the road at a gate. Two columns rise from the walls to mark the spot of the gate, which opens into a property with three tall haystacks and a house. To our left, the house is painted with areas of warm yellow for the walls, honey brown for the roof, which is outlined in navy blue, and turquoise for the doors and windows. A few green trees, made of dots of bottle and forest green, are scattered near the house and haystacks. One sapphire-blue tree grows near the house. A band of azure blue along the horizon, which comes about two-thirds of the way up the painting, suggests a mountain range in the distance. Swirls of white suggest clouds in the turquoise sky. The paint is visibly textured throughout.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/51c369a2-cc20-43f6-8262-25877c4377eb/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The scene is painted loosely, making some details indistinct. The woman’s torso faces us but her legs are angled slightly to our right, and she looks off in that direction with dark brown eyes under dark, arched brows. Her features are loosely painted but she seems to have a straight nose and her small, scarlet-red mouth is closed. Her dark brown hair curls down to her ears in a chin-length bob. She wears only a gauzy, transparent cloth, which is gathered low on her hips with a golden-brown belt. Loosely painted, short and zigzag strokes of chocolate brown and harvest gold suggest a wide band of embroidery or decoration around the bottom hem. The woman’s raised arms show two tufts of dark brown hair in her armpits. She has round breasts with dark pink nipples, and a curving belly and hips. Her left knee, farther from us, is bent sharply against the back of the chair so her foot is tucked behind her other thigh. The chair is striped with lime green, white, and lemon yellow. The floor is terracotta orange. A strip of light blue with a gold pattern to the left and a red area with a flower pattern to our right suggest fabrics draped on the sand-brown wall. The artist signed the work in the lower left corner, ""Henri Matisse.""","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/55424572-8a01-458d-af68-3d57d4f1867d/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The black bodice of her dress has puffed, elbow-length sleeves and a low-cut square neckline. The lime-green skirt flares around her dancing feet to billow up and reveal layers of bubblegum pink underneath. Her body is angled to our left as she points her left, black-stockinged foot and holds her arms by her sides. Behind her, thirteen people dressed in sapphire-blue, ocean-green, and black costumes suggest a royal court, including a dark-haired man who wears a brick-red bolero style suit.

A flat expanse of beach stretches in front of us to meet the water to our left. The horizon comes about halfway up the composition, and the sky above is nearly filled with heather-gray and white clouds, with only a few patches of light blue sky. Several earth-brown and black boats are pulled up onto the beach, to our left. A few poles and one anchor lie among them. A single, light gray and white pole lies perpendicular to the rest, coming toward us in the sand, higher up on the beach. Along the beach, beyond these boats, a man stands next to a woman holding a baby. The man wears an aquamarine-blue shirt and black pants and cap, and the woman wears a dress with a gray shirt and black skirt, partially covered by a cream-white apron. Several other adults and children stand and sit near boats to either side of the pair. The people are loosely painted, with only a few swipes and touches of paint, so details are indistinct. To our right, moss-green and camel-brown dunes rise from the beach, which lead to higher hills along the shoreline. The beach curves away from us to our right and then back out to our left, like a backward C. A sailboat with a fawn-brown sail sits along the beach at the curve, in the distance. A few buildings, painted with gray, yellow, red, and navy blue perch atop some hills, and more are suggested with dabs and strokes of slate blue and parchment white in the valley between hills. Farthest from us, the land rises to a high, long, flat promontory that extends about two-thirds of the way across the painting. The water in the bay is frosty, seafoam green, and a few strokes of white along the shore suggest waves. The water’s surface is mostly flat with a couple small, ink-black boats floating near the left edge and more along the horizon. The artist signed the work in brown paint in the lower right corner, “Claude Monet.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/579777b9-33fb-493e-8e2c-89b972019854/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

They all have pale skin tinged with blue. At the center, the young woman, Mary, is draped in a cobalt-blue mantle that partially covers her head and falls to her shoulders to wrap around a dusky rose-pink gown. The mantle is pushed back from one side of her head, revealing dark brown hair. Her right arm embraces the shoulders of the old woman standing next to her, to our left, who leans toward Mary. A tangerine-orange cloak wraps around the older woman and her hair is covered by a white cowl. Both women have long faces and noses with deep set eyes under thick arched brows, and they gaze down at the infant. The mostly bald, pudgy baby lies across a white piece of fabric, two corners of which are held up by the older woman. Another young boy stands alongside Mary to our right. He faces us, holding a basket or glass bowl containing oval-shaped caramel-brown objects the size of figs in one hand. His elongated head is crowned with tawny brown hair, and his face turns away from the infant to gaze off to our right. One finger of his left hand, on our right, rests alongside his rose-red lips. The elderly man stands behind him, leaning over Mary’s shoulder to look at the older woman. We see him from the waist up with a golden-yellow cloak layered over an olive-green vest, and the arm we see is clad in a white sleeve. The group takes up most of the height of the composition and are crowded together against an azure-blue sky swirling with thin gray and white clouds. The scene is painted largely with long strokes of saturated color. The dark gray ground below is painted with sketchy strokes of white, blue, and pink.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/57c9e253-fe58-47fb-ab1f-80176b9f65ed/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The scene is loosely drawn so many details are difficult to make out. The man we see the most of is shown from the ankles up, standing near the lower right corner of the composition. He faces away from us with his hands in his pockets. The ballerina stands facing our right next to him, and she is cut off by the right edge of the composition. She has pale skin and dark hair, and a black ribbon is tied around her neck. She wears a knee-length white tutu with a crimson-red sash tied around the waist of the white bodice. One pink leg raised parallel to the ground disappears behind the man in black. The stage beneath them is streaked with sand brown and pale gray. A tree trunk and branches leans into the scene from the upper right corner. Part of a stage set painted with mostly straw yellow with touches of mint green screens off the view to our left. Two sets of black suit pants show that a pair of men stand behind it, facing the back of the stage. One of them rests his hand on a cane. The backdrop across the back is painted with greenery below a blue sky. In a gap between the lower edge of the backdrop and the stage, about ten pairs of legs, clad either in pink stockings with white shoes or brown stockings with yellow shoes, are visible from the thighs down. One more pair of black, trouser-covered legs stand with feet planted at hip width, to our right. The artist signed the work in black letters near the lower left corner, “Degas.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/5a14b1e2-d6de-4944-9ae3-ff6132c54393/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The girls all wear dance costumes with knee length tutus, tight bodices, and belts in canary yellow, rose pink, or royal blue. The girls all have brown or dark blond hair. The room seems to be mostly lit from windows on the wall opposite us so some of the girls’ faces are in shadow, but all appear to have light skin. Starting from the left, two dancers are visible from the waist down as they descend a spiral staircase that rises along the left edge of the canvas and off the top. To our left of center is a knot of several dancers, two of whom stand on their toes en pointe, with arms raised. Further right and closest to us, four dancers cluster around a mahogany-brown bench. Rose-pink ballet slippers are piled next to a seated dancer wearing a scarlet-red jacket over her costume. Her head is turned to our right, looking at the girl standing next to her. On the other side of the bench, another dancer bends over to reach her feet, presumably tying on her slippers. The fourth stands on the far right with her back to us, her head turned to our left to look back at the central group. More dancers practice in a room beyond, seen through a wide, squared opening in the upper right of the composition. The room we seem to be in has dark olive-green walls and the room beyond has brighter, parchment-yellow walls. The faces and some details of the costume are loosely painted so their features are indistinct. The artist signed the painting in the lower right corner, “Degas.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/5aabd016-748d-4f81-855d-7963dc5a62b4/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The flowers, vase, the round tabletop on which they sit, and the background are loosely painted with visible brushstrokes of vibrant color. The flowers have long, pointed petals like daisies. The bouquet is rimmed with a ring of verdant leaves near where the stems gather in the narrow neck of the cylindrical, ivory-white vase. The vase might sit on a circular cloth edged with alternating sage-green and plum-purple forms like pompoms, but the loose painting style makes these details difficult to make out. The round tabletop is cropped by left and bottom edges of the canvas.

The lower half of the composition is a mass of tall wildflowers created with daubs of lemon yellow and white among vertical strokes of moss, laurel, and pine green. The river beyond is painted with horizontal dashes of arctic, denim, and cobalt blue. The horizon comes about two-thirds of the way up the composition and is lined with tall, narrow trees, trees with rounded canopies, and a blanket of green growth loosely painted and shaded with touches of blue. The sky above is painted with blended strokes of slate blue and cream white. The sky is paler to the right, suggesting sunlight breaking through some of the clouds.

The straight deck of the bridge crosses the center of the composition but angles slightly away from us as it moves to our right. The four low arches of the bridge are ash brown on their face, and their curved undersides are cobalt blue. Marigold-orange and teal-blue marks on the deck above suggest traffic, and shell-pink smoke or steam billows over our side of the bridge. Three long, narrow forms in the water between and in front of the bridge pilings suggest boats. The sky above is painted loosely with icy blue and pale peach around the slate-blue silhouettes of buildings and smokestacks lining the far bank.

The composition is dominated by shades of blue and pale green. On the right side and closest to us, a woman sits opposite a man at a butter-yellow table, both facing our left in profile. The table extends in from the right, almost halfway up the canvas. The pair are shown from the knees up and span most of the height of the painting. The woman wears a long, teal-blue jacket over a peanut-brown skirt and a frilled cap topped with a pine-green bow. The man wears an olive-green bowler and cinnamon-brown coat, and rests one arm on the table. Two glasses sit on the table in front of them. In the center of the painting, a woman wearing a long, black coat stands on the far side of the table, her head nearly reaching the top edge of the composition. Her body is angled slightly to our right and she gazes off in that direction. Beyond her is another table with two men partly obscured by the couple in front of us. One sitting at the table has flame-red hair topped with a round cap, and a portion of his aqua and peacock-blue striped jacket is visible. Near him, another person in a dark garment with a high collar stands with their back to us, most of the head cropped by the top edge. Along the left side, two women stand one behind the other with their backs to us. The woman closest to us looks away, wearing a short, parchment-white jacket over an aquamarine-blue skirt. The jacket is belted at the waist and the collar, upper back, and long cuffs are rust red. The woman beyond her turns her head to our right in profile, and wears a light blue jacket and pale green skirt. The features and clothing of each person in the scene is outlined in charcoal gray. The artist signed the painting in the upper right corner, “HTLautrec,” with the H, T, and L interlocking to make a monogram.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/5f555497-c954-433e-b2b4-dd26a412c9ed/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

A slender, spruce-blue tree divides the picture just to our left of center. The ground around the tree spans the width of the composition and is carpeted in coral orange, carnation pink, and lavender purple with a handful of emerald-green saplings and tufts of grass. A pair of young women are to each side of the central tree, and a body of water extends across the composition just beyond this bit of land. To our left, the two women’s bodies face away, and they look back over their left shoulders at us. The girl on the left has black hair and wears a honey-orange and pale blue fabric wrapped around her waist. The girl next to her has copper-red hair with a pink cloth wrapped around her chest. They stand by or in the water so are shown from the knees up. The water there is made up of swirling pools of flame red and golden yellow bordered by lilac purple and peacock blue. On the other side of the tree, a young woman with white flowers in her brown hair sits on the ground, also with her back to us. The fourth faces us along the right edge of the canvas. She has black hair and stands next to and touches a thicker tree trunk with one hand. These two women are nude. The water beyond them is painted with patches of rose pink, lemon yellow, and ice blue. Areas mottled with teal, honeydew, and bottle green suggest shrubs and trees lining the far side of the water. Closer inspection reveals two ghostly, pale blue dogs lying on the ground near the lower right corner.

The scene is painted with mostly flat areas of color. Closest to us, along the bottom edge of the canvas, a woman wearing a white cap and dress and a navy-blue jacket stands among three black and white spotted cows, which form a line facing our left in profile. Several round, tangerine-orange forms surround the head of the cow near the lower right corner. The strip of land on the other side of the cows is divided into alternating rows of spring green and coral pink to our left, and forest green dotted with white to our right. The landscape stretches to the horizon, which comes two-thirds of the way up the composition. Rectangular parcels of land are dotted with four rust-brown haystacks beyond the cows, and trees cluster around several brown roofs in the distance to our right. A band of cream-white clouds lines the horizon beneath the topaz-blue sky above. The artist signed and dated the work in dark paint against the white of the cow in the lower right corner: “P. Gauguin 90.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/616710e4-6ccc-4a35-a809-5f30dcf12b39/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The scene is loosely painted so some details are indistinct, but she seems to face a mirror above the small table of a vanity. Visible brushstrokes in tones of pale peach and pink, taupe, and faint sage green capture her spine, shoulder blades, the muscles of her arms, and the dimple above her round buttocks. She uses both hands to pin up her chestnut-brown hair above a rectangular clip painted in muted gold with touches of light pink. She sits sideways in a wooden chair so the ladder-back is to our right. Her thighs are wrapped in a fluffy white piece of cloth, perhaps a towel, which may be wrapped with a ruby-red cloth or it could be a red cushion beneath. The surface of the narrow tabletop in front of her, to our left, is painted with areas of sage green, elephant gray, and royal blue. About a dozen orbs in coral orange and fuchsia pink above and around a band of canary yellow suggest flowers in a yellow vase along the left side of the table. The mirror above the vanity has a wide, gold frame. The woman’s reflection is painted with long strokes of ash brown with a few touches of rose pink. Though abstracted, the reflection seems to capture her torso and one bent elbow. The wall to our left of the vanity is pale pea green and to our right, dark brown. Streaks of honey-brown against a black field in the lower right corner suggests an area rug on an otherwise peanut-brown floor. The artist signed the work in marine blue in the lower left corner, “Henri Matisse.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/62c0e343-9e01-4b3c-b539-38929f691e04/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

Filling the lower right quadrant of the composition, the winged woman, Melencolia, sits with her body angled to our left, and she looks in that direction from under furrowed brows. Lit from our right, her face is cast in shadow, but she has a straight nose and her lips are closed. She wears a ring of leaves over hair that falls in waves over her shoulders. Wings curve up from her back, and she wears a long-sleeved dress with a tight bodice and a voluminous, pleated skirt. She rests her chin on one tightly closed fist. The other arm rests on a book in her lap, and she holds one of the two legs of a tall compass in that hand. Several keys hang on a ribbon looped onto her belt, and they nestle into the deep folds of her skirt. Around her feet are a purse cinched closed, several nails, the metal tip of a bellows, a saw, a plane, the end of a pair of pincers, an ink pot, a molder’s form for baseboards, and a round sphere about the size of a basketball. The dog lies in a tight circle to our left of Melencolia’s feet, its chin resting across its paws. The dog’s ribs show through the short fur of its hide. Next to the dog, the millstone leans against the building that fills the right half of the composition. The millstone is round and flat, is about the height of the woman's torso, and a hole is cut from its center. A chubby child sits atop the stone. It has short, curly hair, stubby wings, a loose robe, and it draws on a tablet propped on its lap. Beyond the child, a wooden ladder leans against the building, and a pair of scales hangs above his head. On the face of the building, hanging over Melencolia’s head, is an hourglass with the sand about halfway spent and a magic square, which is a grid of four rows and four columns. The numbers in the grid read, from left to right, 16, 3, 2, 13 in the top row; an upside down 5, a 10, 11, and 8 in the second row; a backward 9, a 6, 7, and 12 in the third row; and a 4, 15, 14, and 1 in the bottom row. A bell hangs from a ring above this grid. On the step beyond the sleeping dog and millstone, another large stone is carved into flat planes to create an irregular, geometric, rhomboid form about as tall as the millstone. A hammer lies in front of the rhomboid, and beyond it is a melting pot sitting among tongues of flame in a mug-like cup. In the upper left quadrant of the composition, a placid body of water leads back to a distant town and small boats, beneath a starburst that fills the sky. An arched rainbow crosses the sky over a rat-like bat with its sharp teeth and tongue showing. It holds a banner reading “MELENCOLIA I.” The artist signed and dated the engraving as if he had carved into the front face of the step on which Melencolia sits, near the lower right corner: “1514 AD,” with the uppercase D nestled between the long legs of the wide, uppercase A.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/637e0ba3-4acc-4ec4-b912-151c96d9dc12/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The rest of his body is blocked in loosely with lapis blue except the cuff we can see, which is bright white. The young man and boy look on from near the man’s shins on the far side of the bed. Both have close-cropped hair. The young man cranes his neck forward, and his head and shoulders are surrounded by a white field against the brown cardboard on which this is painted. His garment is white over the shoulders and red on the torso. Only the head and neck of the boy are visible beyond the prone man. The artist signed the work in black in the lower right corner, “Picasso.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/641cc91f-5e9a-46eb-9c43-bdf0f805b5e7/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

Cupid’s body is angled to our left, where he hunches over the shoulder-high wheel. He has round cheeks, delicate facial features, and chubby rolls at his wrists and thighs. He is nude except for white cloths fluttering across his torso and another lifting up behind him from around his neck. His face turns to us, and he looks down. Both hands are draped over the spoked wheel to our left. A tree grows behind Cupid, to our right, and an animal skull hangs from ribbons on a low branch, in the upper right corner of the canvas. The skull has a long muzzle like a deer. Cupid’s short curls, the cloths, and the ribbons swirl in different directions. A few plants grow around the base of the tree and clouds billow in the shallow background.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/65c3d1bf-46c0-439d-a489-d36e0471328d/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

Filling the lower right quadrant of the composition, the winged woman, Melencolia, sits with her body angled to our left, and she looks in that direction from under furrowed brows. Lit from our right, her face is cast in shadow, but she has a straight nose and her lips are closed. She wears a ring of leaves over hair that falls in waves over her shoulders. Wings curve up from her back, and she wears a long-sleeved dress with a tight bodice and a voluminous, pleated skirt. She rests her chin on one tightly closed fist. The other arm rests on a book in her lap, and she holds one of the two legs of a tall compass in that hand. Several keys hang on a ribbon looped onto her belt, and they nestle into the deep folds of her skirt. Around her feet are a purse cinched closed, several nails, the metal tip of a bellows, a saw, a plane, the end of a pair of pincers, an ink pot, a molder’s form for baseboards, and a round sphere about the size of a basketball. The dog lies in a tight circle to our left of Melencolia’s feet, its chin resting across its paws. The dog’s ribs show through the short fur of its hide. Next to the dog, the millstone leans against the building that fills the right half of the composition. The millstone is round and flat, is about the height of the woman's torso, and a hole is cut from its center. A chubby child sits atop the stone. It has short, curly hair, stubby wings, a loose robe, and it draws on a tablet propped on its lap. Beyond the child, a wooden ladder leans against the building, and a pair of scales hangs above his head. On the face of the building, hanging over Melencolia’s head, is an hourglass with the sand about halfway spent and a magic square, which is a grid of four rows and four columns. The numbers in the grid read, from left to right, 16, 3, 2, 13 in the top row; an upside down 5, a 10, 11, and 8 in the second row; a backward 9, a 6, 7, and 12 in the third row; and a 4, 15, 14, and 1 in the bottom row. A bell hangs from a ring above this grid. On the step beyond the sleeping dog and millstone, another large stone is carved into flat planes to create an irregular, geometric, rhomboid form about as tall as the millstone. A hammer lies in front of the rhomboid, and beyond it is a melting pot sitting among tongues of flame in a mug-like cup. In the upper left quadrant of the composition, a placid body of water leads back to a distant town and small boats, beneath a starburst that fills the sky. An arched rainbow crosses the sky over a rat-like bat with its sharp teeth and tongue showing. It holds a banner reading “MELENCOLIA I.” The artist signed and dated the engraving as if he had carved into the front face of the step on which Melencolia sits, near the lower right corner: “1514 AD,” with the uppercase D nestled between the long legs of the wide, uppercase A.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/66fa180e-2013-49ac-9a10-229947a71c70/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The structure has a tall central tower flanked by two shorter towers on each side. All three have an arched opening at the bottom. The outer towers are then flanked by three columns. Almost every inch of the structure is densely covered with architectural ornaments, coats of arms, Gothic text, and panels showing scenes with people in interiors or huge crowds in landscapes. Some scenes show soldiers engaged in battle, groups of kings and clergy, or individual men. Architectural ornament includes mythical creatures, gargoyles, saints, kings, and cherubs. The arched openings are tall and narrow, and have checkered floors. Words in elaborate Latin script appear inside the top of each of the three arches. Two ringed-tailed creatures resembling monkeys prowl outside the central arch. Two shallow steps lead down from the structure to five panels that line the base of the composition. Those five panels are filled with Gothic text. The date, ""1515,"" appears at the base of the outermost column to each side.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/6830fbb8-885a-46e8-8514-6a0bd9f80604/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

In the distance to our left, a pier stretches into the sea along the horizon, which comes about two-thirds of the way up this composition. A sailboat floats just off the pier, near the left edge of the painting. To our right of the lighthouse and extending off the right edge of the canvas, the building has three levels of windows and a row of dormers along the tall, peaked roof. The building is painted with touches of dove gray, sapphire blue, and pale pink. In front of the building and to our right, a denim-blue shed has a tangerine-orange roof. A wooden rowboat outlined in cornflower blue with flecks of dandelion yellow rests on the sand next to the shed. In front of us, dots of moss green blend into the blond tones of the sand, creating an impression of grass on the beach. Sunlight shimmers on the sea to our left, which is painted with short dashes of mint and seafoam green, baby blue, cream, and shell pink, beneath a clear, ice-blue sky.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/68979753-2414-4f87-9111-8f7566d54077/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The fronds of the palm radiate like a starburst against unpainted, cream-white canvas. Three black, vertical bands spaced behind the palm suggest tree trunks, with the rightmost trunk dotted with spring green, perhaps representing moss or the leaves of a vine. The fields of gray to either side of the frond, the turquoise areas below the gray, and the coral at the bottom center are painted with visible brushstrokes, creating a mottled effect. Rounded turquoise forms above the gray are silhouetted against a field of pale blue, perhaps representing the sky along the top edge. A few pointed, oval leaves painted spring green with black outlines dip into the scene from the top of the composition. The artist signed the work in dark green paint in the lower right: “Henri-Matisse.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/69a4e4a6-8e0e-4d4e-9f90-af42ce707245/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

Light falls directly on her oval-shaped face, and she has a pointed chin and a straight nose. Her dark eyebrows are arched and though her eyes initially look dark as well, closer inspection reveals a sliver of silvery blue iris around the eye closer to us. Her full, pink mouth is slightly parted. She wears a brown, perhaps fur, shawl behind her shoulders over her long black dress. A few touches of rust red on the sleeve closer to us suggests a floral pattern but details are mostly lost in this dark area. She wears parchment-white gloves and her left hand, closer to us, appears to be tucked into a pocket or into a fold of her skirt so only the wrist is visible. She cups her opposite hand, perhaps cradling a small object. The fabric of the chair is painted with touches of burnt orange and ivory. Canary-yellow and white flowers dance around her head, presumably cascading from a vase on a table behind her. Most of the background, especially along the left edge, is painted with a field of stone blue but an area of loosely painted terracotta red above her head suggests a patterned wallpaper or more flowers.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/6b3f3a90-5a40-4707-9ce0-cd352c4f1265/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

At the center top of the paper, the angel faces us, gazing down to our left with open mouth and eyebrows drawn together. He has curly hair and lifts his muscular right arm, on our left, with his index finger pointed upward. Crosshatched lines define his body, and quick, curved lines shade his outstretched wings. To our right, one man stands with his body facing the center of the sheet but he turns his head to look up off the top right corner. He has curling hair, a wide mustache, and perhaps a goatee, though his chin is partially hidden by a dark spot on the paper. He has broad shoulders, a thick neck, large hands, and a hint of a muscular leg under his flowing, voluminous robes. He holds a flat, oblong object, possibly a stone tablet, perched on his slightly bent left knee. Seated to our left, the other man faces and looks at us. He also grasps a flat, tablet-like object but holds it up, braced on his right thigh, to our left, and points to it with his other hand. This man also is solidly built and swathed in robes, with a hood over his curly hair. He leans forward, knees apart, and stares out with his brows deeply furrowed. His downturned mouth is set in a bushy, curly beard. Near the bottom of the picture, the bare feet of the two men emerge from the folds of their robes. Touches of white washes on the folds of the robes create a sense of light coming from above and to our right, and charcoal lines reinforce the shadows. A grid is lightly drawn in red chalk lines over the composition. A black stamp in the lower left has the letters “E.C” and another at the center reads, “H de T.

Her nose, eyebrows, and narrow chin are outlined with medium brown, and her pink lips are closed. Her black hair is pulled back under the hat, the wide brim of which droops down either side of her face. A sky-blue ribbon or decoration is on the front of the crown. Her dress has a high collar, a fitted bodice, long sleeves, and a long skirt. Pale pink daubs on the white dress are thickly applied so the texture of the paint can be seen on the surface of the canvas. The background is painted with long and short curved dashes of celery green layered over laurel and cool green. Several tangerine-orange dots, a few shell-pink dabs, and some angular, heart-shaped forms in cobalt blue to each side of the woman suggest flowers.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/6d6753b3-c1ef-494c-9dc3-244e8982c867/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

All the people have pale, peachy skin. The man on the ledge, Saint John, half crouches with knees bent so his body is angled to our right, and he turns his head back to our left to look up to the clouds. Both hands are raised with palms facing up. Saint John has a short, curly white beard and hair, and we see the bottom of his chin, nose, and eyes under heavy brows. He wears a light, rose-pink tunic with crimson drapery across his shoulders billowing around his body. Next to him on the rocky ledge is a book with a scarlet-red cover to our left and a brown eagle to our right. The eagle slightly lifts its wings and looks to our left in profile, mouth open and tongue visible. Tufts of grass and plants grow near Saint John’s feet. The aqua-colored sky fills most of the composition behind Saint John, and a bank of silvery gray clouds lit with pale yellow swirls across the top half of the painting. At the center of the clouds, the second man has a long, white beard and white hair, and wears a muted plum-purple robe. He raises his right hand, to our left, palm down with the first two fingers and thumb extended. Six winged, nude young children nestle near this second man or flutter among the clouds.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/71e09ac6-9143-49fe-b25b-bb4bf5b56dfc/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The scene is loosely painted with areas of flat color and pattern. The people have pale, peachy skin and dark brown hair. Their facial features are painted with dots or short strokes of black. The piano is against the wall to our left. The woman wears a short-sleeved, lemon-yellow dress with a long skirt. A music book is propped on the music stand, and loosely painted objects line the top of the instrument. The wall behind the piano is patterned with white and pale yellow flowers under and around arches against a cranberry-red background. The table where the boys play is in the middle of the room. The players sit in wooden chairs and wear black and white striped jackets with white collars. The boy to our right looks at the board while resting his left cheek, closer to us, in his hand. The other boy looks on with his arms on the table in front of him. The checkerboard sits on a red and white striped cloth, which has lines of black dots in the white strips. Beneath the table is a floral rug with blue and black flowers against a red background. The border is painted loosely with leafy shapes against bright white. Beneath the area rug the floor or another carpet is garnet red with a diamond-shaped grid painted in orange. A petal-pink, upholstered chair sits in front of a tall wardrobe in the back corner of the room. A picture with two violins against a blue background hangs on the side of the furniture to our right. A chest of drawers next to the wardrobe holds a few bowls or objects and a white statue, about half human height. The statue is of a person standing with one knee bent in front of the other, one elbow tucked by the side with that hand held to the chest, and the other bent elbow raised overhead. Pictures hang on the wall around the statue, and the wallpaper there is ivory white with a dark yellow pattern. The artist signed the work in the lower right corner, “Henri Matisse.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/7238d6b4-d11c-42e1-8a35-64727188c4ce/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The scene is loosely painted with visible brushstrokes throughout so many of the details are indistinct. One boat floats near the left edge of the painting and the second is situated a little father back, to our right of center. Both have rust-orange anchors painted near the pointed bows, which face us. Tall, narrow, asparagus-green trees line the far riverbank between the boats. Tall spires and towers of buildings rise in a cluster to our left near that edge of the canvas, and boats cluster near the distant shore to our right.

All three girls wear white headdresses, ankle-length, long-sleeved dresses, and clogs. Each dress has a wide white collar that extends beyond the shoulders. A ruby-red flower is pinned to the brown apron on the two girls whose fronts we see. Their features and clothing are outlined in cobalt blue and filled in with parallel, often visible strokes. To our left, a girl stands with both arms stretched out, one holding the hand of the girl next to her, to our right. The first girl looks off into the distance to our left with dark eyes. She has a button nose, and her peach-colored lips curve down at the corners. Her auburn-red hair is tucked back under her bonnet. Her dress is navy blue, and her stockings are brick red. She steps forward onto her right foot, to our left. The second girl, holding the first girls’ hand, stands facing our right in profile, looking slightly down. Her features are indistinct, but she also seems to have a snub nose and her pink lips are closed. She has blond hair and an emerald-green dress. Her hazelnut-brown stockings match her apron. She also steps forward, but onto her left foot. The third girl stands with her back to us, seen between the first two, as she looks over her shoulder to our right in profile. Her left arm is also raised but her right arm is hidden behind the second girl. The third girl has brown hair and a pointed nose. Her dress is black, and she steps forward onto her right foot. A small dog with brown and white speckled fur sniffs at the grass to our right of the girls. Piles of long grass or hay dot the lemon-lime green field, which dips down behind the girls and to our left to meet a low, stone gray wall. Buildings in plum purple, ivory white, terracotta orange, and ocean blue span the width of the painting beyond the wall. One narrow spire reaches above the other rooflines. Tall, narrow, dark green trees are interspersed among the buildings, and a hill climbs nearly to the top of the canvas to our left. A few thin slate-gray clouds float across a narrow band of shell-pink sky above. The artist signed and dated the work in lower right corner, “P.

The scene is loosely painted with visible strokes and dashes throughout so some details are indistinct. An area of asparagus and moss-green dabs creates a patch of grassy riverbank in the lower right corner of the painting. The rippling, sun-dappled surface of the river is created with short parallel strokes of pale pink, caramel brown, white, sage green, and light blue. An empty sailboat, with its sails tightly furled or removed all together, floats near us to our left of center. It has a single tall, pale wood mast. A similar pole rises from the bottom edge of the picture, presumably the mast of another ship below us or out of our view. Farther out on the water and to our left is another sailboat with full white sails catching the sunlight. The final vessel is loosely painted with a few swipes of goldenrod yellow, black, white, and pink to suggest two people sitting in a rowboat, one of them holding a pink parasol. The gray stone bridge is shaded on our side with denim blue along the faces of the four arches we can see. Several people, painted with a few touches of peach and black, stand at the railing. The bridge angles from near the upper right corner of the canvas to almost the middle of the composition, where it meets a narrow, three-story coral-pink and light gray building. A two-story, white building sits a short distance to its left. They bask in warm sunlight against a row of emerald and olive-green trees. A baby-blue sky scattered with puffy white clouds spans the upper half of the composition.

The people all have pale skin, and the women’s blond hair is bound up. Close to us and at the bottom center of the composition, the man and women walk to our right with their eyes cast down. The man walks at the front of the line, holding a stick with a canteen dangling from a cord over his right shoulder. In other left hand, he carries a basket filled with shiny silver disks. The man has wrinkled skin and a long gray beard. He wears a royal-blue coat lined with white fur over a brown tunic, black tights, and gray shoes. His head is wrapped in a turban with yellow coils beneath a purple and green split crown. The two women walk side-by-side behind the man. The woman farther from us holds two sticks in her left hand. A sack is looped over one stick that rests back across her shoulder. The other staff is vertical and is topped a skein of yarn with a spool. She holds a small saffron-orange chest with a silver handle and lock by her side with her right hand. She wears a long, voluminous, amethyst-purple dress bunched up in front to show a forest-green skirt underneath and three silver keys hanging at her knees. The second woman balances a lapis-blue, bulbous pack on her head with one hand. She wears a red dress with a high, white collar. She lifts the red skirt with her other hand to show a royal-blue skirt underneath. The path is lined with plants and a few rocks to each side. The land rises to steep, rocky outcroppings lined with trees. The shadowy form of a person walks away from us on the path where it winds back to the cliffs. The land dips down to a body of water in the near distance beyond the path. Lemon-yellow and crimson-red flames rise out of a town along the water’s edge in the distance. Streaks of black, rose-pink, and slate-blue smoke billow into the air. Another town burns along the horizon, which comes two-thirds of the way up the composition. The artist signed the work with his initials as if he had painted a rock face next to the path to our left, “AD” in a monogram.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/7565a449-f82a-414b-9bda-c93f55a51b4d/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The color palette is dominated by blended earthy brown, green, and pale pink. The horses, which have reddish-brown coats and tails, nearly span the width of the painting. They move to our left with their legs fully extended. Underneath the horses’ flying legs lies the body of a man. The felled rider faces upward, his eyes closed and his legs splayed. He has a light brown beard, mustache, and hair, and pale tan skin. He wears brown riding boots with black tops, white breeches, and a pink jersey with black sleeves. His riding helmet, with a matching pink cover, lies behind his head on the ground. At least three additional horses are in the band, and the two foremost have empty saddles. The two horses beyond them, farther into the picture, have male riders, who wear riding outfits and helmets in colors of smudged and blended orange, lavender purple, and green. They also have brown mustaches and beards. The band races through a field painted with a muddy green interspersed with strokes of orange and white. The horizon line is high, just above the level of the horses’ backs, about four-fifths of the way up the painting. Blue sky peeks out amid a mixture of pale pink and yellow clouds above. There are trees in the background indicated by a few strokes and dashes of paint.

The boys all have light skin and short, blond hair. The barrel is set on flat, wooden beams. The vine behind it has a twisting brown trunk and the dark green canopy is dotted with purple grapes, and it spreads to fill the rounded top of the composition. The clear sky behind the tree is turquoise blue. One boy wearing a crown of grapes and leaves perches in the tree and looks down at the others. He holds a glass with red liquid in one hand and a thin staff in the other. Of the three boys in the barrel, one drinks from a shallow bowl and another holds up a basket of grapes. The third, in the center, holds a bunch of grapes down over the front edge of the barrel. On the ground around the barrel, one boy to our left holds an elongated, gold cornucopia topped with fruit as he looks toward another child straddling the shoulders of a third. At the front center, a boy kneels and drinks from a cup near one who sleeps, stretched out on the ground, using a pitcher as a pillow. To our right, one boy looks up at the tree and the final two play together around another, smaller barrel. The circular painted panel is surrounded by a gold frame.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/77dddf7e-0735-425a-a1cf-e47c8b7b7f92/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

Both people have pale skin. Closest to us, two spindly trees almost reach the top edge of the canvas, their stylized leaves silhouetted against the sky. Trees and bushes with laurel and dark green leaves create a band across the foreground. Near the bottom center of the composition, the woman is closer to us but she turns her face to touch noses with the man riding next to her. Long, straight blond hair flows to her waist. She has pronounced, dark eyes under heavy brows, and a large nose. She wears a burgundy-red jacket with horizontal, gold stripes across the chest. A white shirt beneath shows through where the jacket gapes open at the chest and at her cuffs. She holds the reins of her black horse in her left hand. The man turns his torso toward the woman and wraps his left arm, to our right, around the woman’s shoulders. He looks at her with black eyes under dark brows. He has a black, handlebar mustache and white hair. He wears a black and gold three-corner hat and a navy-blue jacket with gold braid in front and around the neck. His horse is brown with a silvery-white mane. Behind the people, the forest comes about two-thirds of the way up the composition. One tan-brown cloud hangs in the sky that lightens from seafoam green along the top edge to oyster white along the horizon. The artist signed the painting in the lower right: “Henri Rousseau.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/79264fe4-9f16-4e2a-9b93-b6d021eedc8e/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

He looks at us with pale blue eyes under sloping brows. He has an oval face, a rounded nose, and the corners of his closed mouth turn slightly down. His cap has a narrow, rounded, shiny black brim, a gold band around the crown, and a gold embellishment at the front center. The white collar of his shirt is visible along the neckline of his vest, which fastens with two lines of gold-colored buttons. His black jacket, also lined with gold buttons, hangs open. Braided gold ropes are looped under his arm from his right shoulder, to our left. More gold ropes hang down almost to his waist from that shoulder. He has a sky-blue and gold striped belt with a gold medallion at the front center over his vest. Gold bands encircle the wrists of both jacket sleeves, and his trousers are black. His right hand, to our left, rests against the back of the chair, with his palm facing away, and he leans that hip against those fingers. The chair has a coffee-brown back. He rests his other hand by his side, possibly on the hilt of a dagger or sword hanging from his far hip. The wall behind him is rust red.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/7aa1fd7d-633b-42ed-b05c-86e2eefe30b2/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

We look straight onto the buildings and slightly down onto the earth in front of us. About a third of the way up the composition, the horizon is lined with trees and mountains in the deep distance. The long, spindly branches of the central tree nearly reach the top edge of the painting and abstracted, sickle-shaped leaves are silhouetted against the sky so no leaves overlap. The far edge of the whitewashed structure to our left is cropped. The façade is pierced by two small rectangular windows and an arched hatch at the top under a winch. The back end of a horse is visible through an open door at the bottom center. Horizontal bands in front of the building suggest furrows in plowed earth, and a single stalk of corn grows up into the scene, seeming close to us. A pen protected by netting stretches out in front of the second structure, to our right of center. That wood-frame building has a triangular peaked roof, and the left half is open, like a lean-to. A goat, rooster, birds, and several rabbits occupy the pen. Watering cans, buckets and pails, a hoe, newspaper, lizard, and snail are spaced around the buildings. A tiny stylized person, perhaps a baby, appears in the distance between the buildings near a well where a woman works. A covered wagon, a round mill, trees, and plants fill the rest of the space between the buildings. A disk-like moon hangs in the sky to the right of the tree. The artist signed and dated the lower left corner, ""Miro. 1921-22.""","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/7c707158-95a0-4b7c-b6d3-db5a7567817b/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The fish lies on its side with its belly facing us, and one bulging eye peers off to our left. A man wearing a helmet holds a knife twice his own size with the blade up as he cuts the fish’s belly. Fish and scallop shells of all sizes tumble from its cavernous mouth and side. Several fish also have smaller fish in their mouths. On the far side of the fish, a man stands on a ladder braced against the enormous creature, holding a raised trident as he looks down, his face covered by the wide brim of his hat. On the land to our right is another smaller fish with human legs, which carries a fish in its mouth. It passes a man who carries a fish on his back outside a dilapidated cottage as he climbs a ladder leaning against a tree. Two other fish hang from the tree’s branches. Around the shoreline to the left, fish surface with more fish in their mouths. A man and a boy wearing tunics and long headdresses sit in a rowboat close to us, pointing as a second man in the boat holds a knife in his teeth and pulls a small fish from the body of a larger one. The word “ECCE” is inscribe near the pointing man’s hand. Another man sits on the beach further up the shoreline, about to catch a fish using fish as bait. The water stretches back to a town in the far distance. Boats float in the middle distance and some approach another whale-sized fish beached on a small island behind a tall rocky outcropping. About a dozen people with spears gather on the island around that fish. A flock of birds fly in silhouette in the distance beyond the island. A flying creature closer to us has a scaly body, gaping mouth, wavy tail, and teardrop-shaped wings. An inscription in the upper left corner reads, “Grandibus exigui sunt pisces piscibus esca.” The print is signed in the lower left corner, “CJVisscher excud,” with the CJV joined to make a monogram. An inscription printed in the margin under the image reads, “Siet sone dit heb’ick seer lange gheweten Dat die groote Vissen de cleyne eten. P.

The brushstrokes are unconnected and visible, so many of the details difficult to make out. Facing our left almost in profile, the woman’s form is suggested with thick strokes of eggshell white, periwinkle blue, mint green, and deep pink. We get the impression of a light-colored dress that pools around her hips and legs, and a hat atop dark hair. Her face is painted with an area of blush peach. The blades of grass near her are layered with shamrock and moss green against lighter areas of honeydew green. The tree trunks are painted with streaks of cobalt blue and lilac purple, and long, whip-like, spindly branches reach vertically into the sky. Dashes of lavender purple and straw yellow suggest leaves in the feathery canopies. A sand-colored band running across the composition in the distance could be a path or a river, lined on the far side by loosely painted, periwinkle-blue buildings under a pale, butter-yellow sky. The artist signed and dated the work in black paint in the lower left corner, “1880 Claude Monet.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/7dbe4a11-dbd7-404a-a199-dfb5c5ddc802/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The girl looks at us with wide, gray eyes under delicately arched eyebrows. She has a short, rounded nose, and her full, pink lips are parted. Her smooth, rounded cheeks are flushed. She wears a lace-trimmed, sky-blue, scoop-necked bodice that comes to a V at her waist, a full, ankle-length black skirt, and a white bonnet with a royal-blue ribbon, which has a pink rose at the bow. Her long, white, lacy veil, called a mantilla, drapes over the hat, over her shoulders, and to her waist. One end of the mantilla drapes over her left wrist, to our right. The other end is pinned under the back of her other hand, which rests against that hip. One cobalt-blue, pointed shoe with a silver buckle peeks out under her skirt. A small, shaggy, white-haired dog sits at her feet to our right. A low, gray stone wall behind the girl and dog angles away from us to the left. Some plants with dark green leaves grow in front of the wall to our left. Beyond the wall, pine-green, treed foothills rise to meet rocky, nickel-gray mountains under a ice-blue sky with pale, petal-pink clouds kicking up over the mountains. An inscription in all capital letters is painted in black in the lower left corner: “LA S.D. MARIA TERESA HIXA DEL SER. INFANTE D. LUIS DE EDAD DE DOS ANOS Y NUEVE MESES.” A crimson-red letter “B.” is painted to the left nearby. In the lower right corner, the number “15.” is painted in white and the number “5.” is painted in red.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/7f6da94c-914c-48e3-88ff-fbe75e4ed079/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

A patch of green grass lines the riverbank in the lower right corner of the canvas. The land curves away out of sight, and then back into the scene below the abutment of the bridge along the right side of the painting. From the ivory-colored abutment, the straight deck of the bridge is supported by two shallow, iron-gray arches, and the bridge extends off the left side of the composition. Dots of red and gray on the bridge suggest vehicles or pedestrians. The river below is painted with blended strokes of silvery gray, icy blue, and pale lavender purple around the low-sided sailboats. One turquoise-colored houseboat is pulled up to the riverbank to our right. The long, rectangular, flat-topped building is pierced with two stories of windows, which are outlined in spruce green against the golden yellow. The horizon line runs just below the bridge deck, just under halfway up the composition. The sky above is painted with longer swipes of cream white and smoke gray. Loose, short brushstrokes are visible throughout, especially in the water, boats, and bridge. The artist signed the painting in the lower right corner, ""Claude Monet.""","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/823405e0-599f-4fd8-ae71-4d901edc36b0/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The horizon line comes less than a quarter of the way up the composition, and the sky behind the men and horse is vivid, aqua blue with a few silvery-gray and pale, yellow clouds floating along the top edge of the composition. The painting is created with long, blended brushstrokes, and the limbs and features of the two men and horse are elongated and have delicate, dark outlines. The horse’s body is angled to our right but it looks at us from the corners of its dark eyes. One front leg is raised. The rider looks down toward the man on foot at his side, to our left. The rider has dark, arched eyebrows, a long, straight nose, a pointed chin, and short, copper-orange hair. Wide ruffs pleated into figure-eights encircle his neck and wrists. His chest and arms are covered with plates of steel-gray armor edged and decorated with gold bands and medallions. He wears crimson-red pantaloons and stockings with mustard-yellow boots. With his right hand, to our left, he holds the gold hilt of a long, thin sword along the horse’s body. With his other hand, he holds a swath of lime-green fabric, which drapes down the side of the horse and across the hips of the man standing next to the rider. The sheen of the fabric is suggested with canary-yellow highlights where it catches the light. The standing man has short, dark brown hair and eyebrows. He looks to our right in profile, toward the rider, with pink lips parted. He holds the green fabric with his left hand, to our right, and he has a bandage around his leg near his right ankle. The horse and man stand on a spit of dark brown land, with a landscape of trees, buildings, and mountains deep in the distance beyond.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/853fd837-d70a-4d5f-856c-3dfbf5f109f5/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The background or backdrop beyond them shows a grove of deep green trees to our left and a sunset view of meadows leading back to trees to our right. Three of the dancers stand in a row that extends from the lower left corner to our right and away from us. All three wear rust-orange bodices over tutus that are painted loosely with flecks of pale celery green and buttercup yellow against a muted royal-blue background. Their bodices and upper bodies are outlined with black. The woman closest to us stands with her body angled to our right. Her face turns away as she looks to her left and adjusts that shoulder strap. The two dancers farther from us stand with their backs to us, their bodies angled away from us to our left. The middle dancer looks back over her right shoulder as she lifts the other elbow to adjust that strap. The third dancer in the row holds both hands to her right strap as she looks off into the distance, to our left. The fourth ballerina, to our far left beyond this trio, stands with the arm we can see, her left, lifted with her hand held high as she looks off to our right. Her bodice is a brighter carrot orange, and is more loosely painted. The green foliage behind the dancers extends off the top edge of the painting. The pale sage-green field to the right stretches before puffy, rounded trees daubed with mauve-pink highlights. The coral-pink and golden yellow sky is streaked with lavender-gray clouds. The artist signed his name in red paint with tiny, almost illegible letters in the lower right corner, “Degas.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/8677586b-668f-42c9-b76c-f4ab7bdac80d/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The woman’s left hand, to our right, supports the baby’s neck, and her other hand holds him upright. Both have pale skin tinged with pink and shaded with cool gray, and they face us at the center of the composition. The woman wears a royal-blue hooded garment that comes low over her forehead. Light blond curls catch the light under her hood, near her left cheek, to our right. She looks into the distance, as if over our right shoulder, with unfocused, pale brown eyes. She has a straight yet soft nose, flushed cheeks, closed pink lips, and a slight double chin. The nude baby has blond hair and blue eyes. His torso and limbs have the rolls and dimples of a toddler, and the woman’s hands press gently into the flesh. One of his elbows hooks up over the woman’s shoulder, next to his head. He points at the woman with his middle finger near her high neckline. The other arm, to our right, hangs by his side and he holds a piece of green and red fruit, possibly an apple. The child stands on one foot on the green cushion, which has red tassels. The pine-green pillow has sea glass-green highlights, suggesting a sheen or texture. His other foot rests against that standing calf, toes splayed. The wall behind the pair is marbled with green or red against tan, and a bright, scarlet-red cloth hangs behind the woman. A window on the back wall opens onto a landscape to our left. There, a plain of green grass is interrupted by a winding pathway, which leads to a walled fortification and gate. Beyond the gate are trees and mountains, hazy green and blue in the deep distance. Thick white clouds drift across the bright blue sky above. A sliver of a window in the upper right corner next to the baby has round, bull’s eye glass. In the lower corners of the painting are two heraldic coats of arms. The shield-shaped symbol to our left is of a knight’s helmet with red and white scrolls and vines.

The men, clothing, and horses closest to us are painted with dashes and swirling brushstrokes, which contrasts with the soft look of the approaching crowd and landscape beyond, which are painted indistinctly with loose and blended brushstrokes. All the men we can see have medium brown skin and are armed with rifles. The men close to us wear long tunics and boots in shades of teal blue, ivory white, crimson red, earth brown, and golden yellow. Most of them wear turbans and some have straight or curved daggers hanging from their waists. Closest to us in the bottom left, a chestnut-brown horse with a black mane collapses on its rider, who sprawls along the ground with arms overhead. The horse lifts its head and twists back toward us facing our left, so the white blazes down its nose are visible. Near the horse’s legs and along the left edge of the painting, a man wearing a mustard-yellow tunic kneels and leans his forehead against the barrel of his rifle, which he braces like a walking stick. His other hand rests on the hilt of his dagger at his waist. To our right of the fallen horse, six men line up along a low rise that angles to our right and into the distance, where it meets a grove of green trees. At the front of that group, near the lower center of the composition, a rider on a dark horse charges the approaching men. Those men emerge from a line of emerald-green trees and growth at the foot of a steep, rocky hill. These men are more loosely painted so details are difficult to make out, but several are backlit by white smoke, presumably from firing their rifles. The hill above is mottled with warm taupe, light gray, cinnamon-brown, and moss-green growth. Atop the hill and to our left, a walled building complex with thick, square towers faces a row of sheer cliffs that march in from the upper right to enclose the space. Their jagged faces are shadowed with cool tones of slate blue, pewter gray, and touches of rust red. An azure-blue sky, scattered with thin layers of steel-gray and white clouds, spans the top of the composition. Bright sunlight flows in from the upper right, illuminating the fallen horse and the men near it. Sunlight also warms the face of the terracotta building and the hill, as well as the peaks of the mountains on the right. The artist signed and dated the work in black in the lower center: “Eug. Delacroix 1863.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/87ece172-f4cb-4a1c-9439-3f29ef085665/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The woman's body is angled to our right but her face turns to us. She has chalk-white, smooth skin with heavily lidded, light brown eyes, and her pale pink lips are closed. Pale blush highlights her cheeks, and she looks either at us or very slightly away from our eyes. Her brown hair is parted down the middle and pulled back, but tight, lively curls frame her face. Her hair turns gold where the light shines on it. She wears a brown dress, trimmed along the square neckline with gold. The front of the bodice is tied with a blue ribbon, and the lacing holes are also edged with gold. A sheer white veil covers her chest and is pinned at the center with a small gold ball. The bush fills the space around her head with copper-brown, spiky leaves. A river winds between trees and rolling hills in the distance to our right. Trees and a town along the horizon, which comes about halfway up the painting, is pale blue under an ice-blue sky.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/8f29e3c9-a289-4d53-abf0-31a66e9e98fa/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

Her cheeks are rosy and her dark hair is pulled back, though it seems looser down the sides of her face. A small, coral-red, crescent shape at the back of her head could be covering her hair or holding it in place. White, nearly translucent fabric lies loosely across her shoulders over a dark, moss-brown, long-sleeved dress. Her breasts swell over the squared, lace-trimmed neckline. She holds white fabric and perhaps a needle in her hands, which rest on a tan cushion on her lap. The scene is loosely painted throughout so some of the details are difficult to make out. A darker spot along her right index finger could be a thimble. The background is the same olive-tan of the cushion.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/9150722c-f34d-484b-aa58-4079c7e85850/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The scene is loosely painted with areas of mostly flat color, especially in the background, so some details are difficult to make out. The woman is centered in the composition, and her legs stretch to our left. She has upswept dark brown hair, peach-colored skin, and her eyes, nose, and mouth are drawn with dark gray lines. Her blousy top is vertically patterned with lead-gray leaves down the front and elongated dots on the sleeves. Each sleeve also has a carrot-orange band on the upper arm. Her skirt is spearmint green, and she wears bone-white pumps. She sits in a canary-yellow armchair with red down the front of the arms and along the bottom, where the wood frame would be. One foot stretches to rest on a matching footstool, while her other leg is curled under her. The denim-blue floor tilts toward us and is covered with thin white lines in a chevron pattern. In the lower right is a red table with a bright yellow vase covered with swipes of brown and green. The vase is filled with elongated, abstract mauve-pink and mint-green shapes on slender white stems. The back wall of the room has an aqua-green cabinet to our left, which holds a silver urn and dishes of round objects. There is also a cantaloupe-orange footstool and other pieces of small furniture there, below paintings on the white wall. Above the woman is a white door with panels outlined in gray, and a section of black wall to our right has more paintings. The artist signed and dated the lower right, “Henri Matisse 40.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/918ee33f-cdd0-40e2-ab70-bab30048b14b/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The scene is loosely painted with visible brushstrokes, so many details are indistinct. To our left, the gray tree trunk sways to the left as the branches of its skeletal canopy nearly span the width of the painting. The path extends from the lower right corner of the painting into the distance, around a lattice-like fence, which also runs across the width of the canvas. To our right and facing away from us, a person wearing brown pants, a sky-blue shirt, and a gray cap leans his forearms on the chest-high fence as he presumably talks with the woman standing on the other side. She wears a long navy-blue dress with a sea-blue apron and a tan hat. The land enclosed within the fence is painted with bands of peanut brown and sage green. Another woman wearing a slate-blue skirt, a sky-blue shirt, and a white cap walks away from us down the path using a cane or walking stick. To her right is a thicket of loosely painted moss-green and rust-brown foliage. Across a gully in the distance, a white picket fence separates us from the small village. The buildings have white or beige walls and pitched terracotta-red, tan, or denim-blue roofs. Beyond these structures, flax-brown trees are silhouetted against a light blue sky with fluffy white clouds. The artist signed and dated the painting in dark brown in the lower left corner: “C. Pissarro. 1872.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/94413b0f-688f-4cf4-9a08-f52e836faab4/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The woman's body is angled to our right, and she cuts her black eyes back to look off to our left. She touches her chin with the fingertips of her right hand, closer to us, while her left hand holds a white cloth over her groin. The ground beneath her is swirled with bright pink, lilac purple, and some strokes of canary yellow. To our left and behind the woman, the man wears a topaz-blue robe, and he kneels with his hands on his knees. A band of vivid orange and kelly green in front of his knees could be abstracted flowers. His oval face is rimmed with a band of black. He has a wide nose, and his pink lips are parted to reveal his teeth. His eyes are wide open as he looks down under black brows. A craggy, dark teal-blue tree trunk curves up and across the background, and a red and green faced serpent floats near the upper right corner.

The women to the left and center stand with their backs to us. The woman to our right and the woman on the far side of the circle face us. Their hair is bound up in headdresses, scarves, or veils. The woman to our right holds a swath of drapery across her hips and it cascades to the floor near a skull and long bone resting at their feet.

The demon peeking from the shadows along the left edge has a snout like a lion, and its gaping jaws reveal sharp teeth and a long tongue. It clutches a pair of thin sticks in one paw and flames flare up behind it. The contours of the women and the room are shaded with long, parallel strokes and crosshatching. A monogram with a capital D tucked between the legs of a wide, upper case A is inscribed at the bottom center of the sheet.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/952e3d8a-1131-45ba-af9e-83ad4a504633/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The scene is loosely painted, and the color palette is almost completely dominated by cool tones of spring, sage, celery, and kelly green, and steel and sea blue. The grasses near us are painted with diagonal strokes that alternate direction and color as they move back toward the river. Golden yellow daubs in the lower right suggest blooms, and leaves on the trees are created with thin, upward strokes and dabs along slender branches. The trees reach high into a sky filled with sweeps of beige, blush pink, and spring green layered over pale blue.

The woman stands at the center of the composition, and the moss-green parasol she holds over her head almost brushes the top edge of the canvas. Her body faces our left but she turns her head to look at us. Her long dress is painted largely with strokes of pale blue and gray with a few touches of yellow. Her voluminous skirts swirl around her legs to our left. She holds the parasol with both hands, and her brown hair is covered with a hat. Long strokes of white paint across her face suggest a veil fluttering in the breeze. The tall grass she stands in is dotted with buttercup yellow and plum purple, and she casts a long diagonal shadow along the grass toward us. The young boy seems to stand on the other side of the hill, since the grass and flowers comes up to his waist. He wears a white jacket and pale yellow straw hat. His arms are by his sides, and he seems to look off into the distance to our left. A sunny blue sky behind the people is dotted with bright blue clouds. The painting is created with loose brushstrokes throughout, and they are especially choppy in the clouds. The artist signed and dated the painting in royal-blue letters at the lower right: “Claude Monet 75.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/99758d9d-c10b-4d02-a198-7e49afb1f3a6/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

Just to our left of center, the woman sits with her body angled to our left and she looks in that direction with pale green eyes. Touches of green shade the inner corners of the eyes, and her complexion has a yellowish cast. Her pink lips are closed and her chestnut-brown hair is parted in the middle and pulled back. Her hands rest in her lap with wrists crossed. The dress darkens from eggshell white on the chest and sleeves to nickel gray on the skirt. Charcoal-gray dots create an irregular pattern that becomes looser as it moves down the skirt. Her dress is cinched at the waist with a black sash. The skirt spreads over her settee, which has a low back that angles up on our left. The peach wall behind her takes up the top half of the composition. The painting is created blended brushstrokes, giving it a soft, almost hazy look.

They all have pale, peachy skin. At the center of the composition, the woman, Venus, sits with her body angled slightly to our right as she turns her head back to our left, gazing into the distance with brown eyes under thick brows. She wears a jeweled headpiece over her upswept, honey-blond hair, and delicate ringlets frame her brow. Her cheeks are tinged with dusty rose-pink, and she has a long nose and a ruby-red, bow mouth. She wears an amber-yellow gown trimmed with white lace at the neckline. The short sleeve we can see is slashed to reveal cream-white fabric puffing out of the openings. A wide, gold chain inset with gleaming pale aquamarine-blue jewels the size of thumbprints drapes over her far shoulder and across her chest like a sash. She wears a pearl necklace and teardrop-shaped earrings, and more pearls and gems adorn the gold bracelets on her wrists. One child, in the lower right corner of the painting, stands in front of her with his back to us. He holds an arrow in his left hand, which he rests on the chocolate-brown cloth draped across Venus’s lap. He turns head to the right, and his face is partially obscured by one of his small, charcoal-gray and cream-white wings. Venus holds two ends of an off-white cloth tied around his head as a blindfold. Just beyond him is another person, visible from the hip up, who fills the height of the composition but is mostly cropped by the right edge. We see the left arm, shoulder, and edge of the hip as they stand with their back to us. The arm we can see is raised to hold what appears to be a metal bowl. On Venus’s opposite side, to our left, the second winged child stands on the ledge on which Venus sits. He leans one hand and his chin on Venus’s shoulder and gazes off to our right. He has chestnut-brown hair and eyes, and a round nose in a pudgy face. Loosely painted cranberry-red drapery hangs from the upper left corner and falls in cascading folds behind him. An azure-blue sky with tan clouds is visible beyond the drapes.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/9c7a8e0c-8e74-492a-9860-f118ce9af68e/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The scene is loosely painted with visible brushstrokes in saturated colors throughout. We look slightly down onto the front corner of the table, where the canary-yellow apples sit in the folds of the tablecloth. The apple closest to us at the corner of the table has a scarlet-red patch on the side facing us. Between the two rightmost apples, the lime is painted in shamrock and fern green. The cloth is bunched up just behind the apples to partially obscure the pitcher sitting near the back of the table. The pitcher is painted with swipes and patches of white, aquamarine blue, and silver gray with gold highlights along its spout. Daubs of pine green, rose pink, and flame red suggest a floral decoration on its side. The wall beyond the table fills the height of the composition, and is scattered with white flowers layered over an aquamarine-blue background. The blossoms seem oversized, each the size of a blown-up balloon. Other leafy forms painted with sapphire blue and plum purple could be more flowers or leaves. Two vertical stripes to the left and right behind the table are made up of strokes and daubs of caramel brown over honey yellow. The artist signed the lower right, “Henri-Matisse.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/9ce56bcb-b6de-4030-adb5-a22f00aaeccd/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The flowers, cloth, and background are painted with visible brushstrokes, making many of the details indistinct. Nestled among moss-green leaves, most of the flowers are red but three pink peonies are interspersed in the bouquet, to our right. One additional red peony lies on the table, near the lower left corner of the painting. The narrow vase holding the flowers has emerald-green ovals against a celery-green background. The fabric bunched on the table is loosely painted in strokes of pumpkin orange, indigo blue, and asparagus green, that together suggest a geometric pattern. The wall behind the bouquet is streaked with sky blue and parchment white, and two pictures hanging one over the other, to our right, are cut off by the top and right edges of the composition. The top picture has a wide, cream-white mat and shows a tan house with a charcoal-gray roof against a blue sky. The bottom picture shows a ballerina wearing a knee-length tutu bent forward over her knees, presumably tying a slipper. The artist inscribed, dated, and signed the work in pine-green paint in the upper left corner, “à M. Théodore Gad son ami” and, underneath, “P Gauguin 84.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/9f47ac4b-d7dd-4b0e-a9f5-3154a787e2fd/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The path is wide at the bottom center of the canvas and narrows as it reaches the steps of a house, beyond the garden. Close to us, four blue and white porcelain urns line the path, separating it from the grassy banks to either side. The urns are filled with tall stems with coral-pink and cardinal-red flowers. The child stands about halfway back along the path, where the garden transitions from grass to the banks of tall sunflowers. A few strokes in front of the child could be a small dog. Behind the child, a woman and another child stand on the steps. The woman wears a cornflower-blue and white dress, while both children have bare legs and wear white clothes and yellow hats. All three have indistinct facial features and peach-colored skin. The house spans with width of the composition. It has an amethyst-purple roofline with two chimneys, and the petal-pink walls have mango-yellow highlights. Windows are covered with blue latticework.

Short strokes of baby and sea blue with touches of white create ripples on the surface on the river, which runs from the lower right corner to the left edge of the canvas. The horizon comes about a third of the way up the composition and is lined with low hills painted in tones of cobalt blue and grass green. We are on or slightly over the left bank of the river, which is painted in strokes of pale peach, pink, and green. A white path running along the top of the bank curves away from us. People, painted with loose strokes of topaz and navy blue, walk on the path, and a few touches of gray, tan, and emerald green suggest a woman and child sitting in the grassy bank, near the water. A lavender-blue sail rises just beyond the far curve of the path, and two narrow dark blue objects jut into the water nearby, presumably long rowboats. The far bank is lined with a dense cluster of tall, spear-like, blue-green trees reaching high into a powder-blue sky, which is filled with swirling, thin puffs of white clouds. Some light blue smudges at the river’s edge in the distance suggest low buildings. The artist signed the lower left, “Sisley.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/a167f440-ad1c-481e-ada0-2f6962d54e64/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

Her chair has a rounded back and arms made from what looks like bent, woody vines, and the background is a solid field of pale aqua. Her dark hair is parted in the middle and tied at the nape of her neck with a red ribbon. Dark eyebrows curve over brown eyes, and she has a rounded nose, and her petal-pink lips are slightly parted. Her pale peach skin is tinged with green on her face and hands. Her right arm, on our left, rests along the arm of the chair. In her other hand, which rests in her lap, she holds a sprig of blooming oleander, with light pink flowers and green leaves. The bodice of her high-necked dress is striped with brick red and royal blue, and is lined with a row of round gold buttons down the front. The sleeves come down to her forearms and the cuffs and collar at her neck are white. Her full skirt is royal blue with pumpkin-orange dots. The brushwork is loose throughout and individual brushstrokes are visible, especially in the stripes of her bodice and the patchy peach tones that make up her skin.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/a2e6da57-3cd1-4235-b20e-95dcaefed6c8/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The textured, lumpy legs taper as they move up. A sinewy rope-like texture runs, like a hem, along the outside of the pointed arch. Another form, like a lip, lines the inner edge where the legs pinch together at the top of the arch. The box balanced on the apex is nearly as wide as the legs. The box has a projecting rim, and is corrugated along the outer surfaces and the front edge, as if it had been cut down from a cardboard box. The circle centered in the box also has a projecting rim, like a tall cake pan. Within the circle, a shape like the wing of a bird appears to have been incised. A curving, bowtie-like shape protruding on a rod from the top of the box is incised with a dot at the center of another circle.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/a31921dc-e81f-482e-b5ba-076b034d231c/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

Though made with oil on cardboard, the paint is applied loosely with visible strokes so the painting looks more like a pastel drawing. The people have peach-colored or mint-green skin. Cut off by the left edge of the painting, the man wears a black top hat and suit. We only see the short blond hair behind one ear and the jutting cheekbone and jaw of his profile. The woman takes up almost the left half of the picture. She wears a flat, brown coat outlined in royal blue, a fur stole around her neck, and a blue hat with flowers. Her brown hair is pulled up, and she looks to our right in profile with pale, nearly ash-white skin. Across from the couple, to our right and farther into the room, a woman wearing a teal-green dress stands with her feet planted wide so her feet flare out and her hands on her hips. Her body is squared toward the couple, and she looks off to our left. A black hat perches on her yellow hair, which is piled atop her head. She cocks one eyebrow over green eyes, and her lips curl in a lopsided sneer over a double chin. A tawny-brown corset under her bust cinches her waist. She gathers the skirt in fistfuls with each hand to reveal white petticoats and black boots or shoes. Two more people stand facing away from us behind her and to our left. Seen between the first pair and this woman, the man here also wears a black top hat and suit, and he has orange hair. The woman has brown hair. Her bodice is vivid pink, and the skirt is dark brown. An arc of white from the hem of her skirt up to her head suggests she has flung that side of the skirt up. Another woman’s face cast with green is tucked between the heads of the first couple. That woman looks off to our left under lifted brows with a drooping mouth. The two couples face a structure with columns supporting a roof, probably a bandstand, in the upper right quadrant of the composition. The ground in the lower half of the picture is streaked with sable brown and olive green. The rest of the background behind the bandstand is filled with sea green against the brown board on which this was painted. An indistinct red mark in the lower right corner has the artist’s initials intertwined, “HTL.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/a338667a-aa34-478d-9108-d44e88acd718/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The rhinoceros’s horn touches the border to the right and its hindquarters the left. Its left foot, farther from us, stands slightly ahead of its right hoof. Its front feet are close together and its head is lowered. Chunky, armor-like plates covering its body are patterned in some areas, especially on its legs and belly, with rings and dots, creating a mottled effect. The skin on its legs is scaly like a fish or reptile. A short, twisted, unicorn-like horn grows from between its shoulders, and the animal’s lower lip and the ear we see is fuzzy with short hairs. Near the upper right, in the corner near the animal's shoulders, the print is inscribed, “1515 RHINOCERVS.” Below, the artist’s initials appear as a monogram, with an upper case D tucked within the legs of an A. Five rows of tightly spaced German writing runs across the top edge of the paper, above the single-line border framing the animal. It reads, ""Nach Christus gepurt. 1513. Jar. Adi. 1. May.

The man and desk take up most of the composition, which has an arched top. The man’s shoulders and body are angled to our right, and he looks off in that direction in profile. His balding head is rimmed with white hair curving over the large ear we can see, and he has a trimmed white and gray beard and mustache. His prominent nose is pointed, and his lips are closed. Light glints off the robe he wears so it shimmers in shades of topaz, aquamarine, and midnight blue. Voluminous white sleeves emerge under the mantle and are edged with narrow lace cuffs. His left hand, to our right, rests on an open book, which is propped against one or two other tomes. Near the edge of the table, two quills stand in the corners of a lidded inkwell, and a round, silver blotter, shaped like an upside-down chalice, and a lidded silver box sit nearby. The man’s chair has a tall post next to his shoulder to our left with a teardrop-shaped, gold finial. A second post, near his wrist, is lower and topped with a gold orb. The chair is draped in the same deep, raspberry-pink of the square table at which he sits. The tablecloth is edged with a wide band of gold along the bottom, and filigree-like gold decorations line the seams or folds at the corners. Brushstrokes are visible in many areas, especially in the colorfully charged blue and pink fabric. Beyond the man, to our right, a statuette of a person wearing a long, white robe over a white dress holds a baby. The clothing is edged with gold, and she wears a sphere-like gold crown. The baby also wears white and holds up one hand. The statuette stands on a platform supported by S-shaped corbels, and could have a projecting, squared awning over the top. This area is more loosely painted so some details are difficult to make out. In the background to our left, a wooden door stands open next to a dark space just behind the man’s head, so his profile is picked out against the shadow. The floor beneath is earth brown.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/a600b632-2bb6-4979-a750-85cee48c24b6/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

One brown eye, to our left, seems to look at us, and the other might look off over our right shoulder. Her nose is indicated with a wavy line for a pointed tip, and her small pink lips are closed. She has a square jaw and a narrow chin. Black hair curls over her ears. The rest of her hair is covered by a turban, which touches the top edge of the composition and is pale pink to our left and ivory white to our right. Her yellow garment is fastened at her throat and has rows of darker gold circles, perhaps buttons or other trim, down the open front over a white shirt. The papaya-orange corners of a square-backed chair is behind her shoulders, about halfway up the picture. The background is streaked with laurel green, flax, and lemonade yellow to our left, and deepens to dark, pewter gray to our right. The artist signed and dated the painting with olive-green script in the upper left corner: “Henri-Matisse 1917.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/a626bd34-36af-4484-9cd8-2caaa7fd670e/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

Both people have pale skin and thin, gold halos floating above their heads. At the center of the composition, the man faces our left in profile as he looks down at the creature. The man has a straight nose and honey-brown hair under his gold-trimmed, pewter-gray helmet. Armor covers his entire body, and a celestial-blue cape billows behind him from where it fastens around his neck. A narrow, indigo-blue and gold band is tied around his left calf, and is inscribed with the word “HONI.” A black sword hangs from his left side. The horse is white with a silvery-white mane and tail. It rears on its hind legs as it turns its head to look at us with hazel-brown eyes. The horse wears a blue saddle and bridle, the same color as the man’s cape, trimmed with gold. A strap around the horse’s neck is painted in gold with the name, “RAPHELLO.” The rider thrusts his foot into the stirrup we can see as he plunges a lance down at the dragon under the horse’s front feet. The dragon has tawny brown skin with a mint green, dog-like head. It grips the earth with clawed feet as at pushes at the lance with one front foot. It twists its long, snake-like neck to look at the man with dark eyes. The dragon opens its pointed snout to show its teeth, and bat-like wings splay out. A tall outcropping over a cave rises along the left edge of the composition, behind the dragon. In a field a little farther back, to our right, the woman kneels with her body angled to our left. She tilts her head away from us and gazes past the man and horse. She has a straight nose, pale pink, bow-shaped lips, and her blond hair is pulled back in a bun. She wears a ruby-red dress and a sheer white wrap around her shoulders and across her arms. Around the woman, straw-yellow hills with bands of pine-green trees roll into the distance.

Up on her toes en pointe, her body faces us but her arms are raised and angled toward the upper left corner of the composition. She turns her upper torso and head to gaze in the direction of her hands. Lighting comes from the front edge of the curving stage and illuminates the man’s pants and undersides of his arms, the dancer’s legs, tutu, and face, and the front part of the stage.

However, the bodies of the horse and rider are shown in front of some of the trees and disappear behind others, confusing the eye. The woman has pale skin and wears a brimless cap the same color as her dress over blond hair. She rides erect, holding the reins to the reddish bay-brown horse, which walks with the back left and front right hooves raised. The tree trunks are painted with sage and forest-green vertical dashes against moss green. The leafy canopies are painted with dabs of grass green. The forest in the background is indicated with short strokes of spring, sage, and mint green. The grass below is created with dashes of emerald green and coffee brown against a golden-tan background. Because of the way the horse and rider are unpredictably covered by trees, our eye constantly shifts back and forth, trying to figure out if the rider is close to us or set farther back in the forest.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/a992c047-d2ea-4979-8e23-1bb1db7df497/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

They all have pale skin and brown or black hair. Across the stage from us, the women’s gowns are petal pink, crimson red, butter yellow, baby or azure blue, or black, and they all wear black chokers around their necks. Their hair is swept up and tied with bows or ornaments to match their dresses. One woman holds a bouquet of flowers in her lap and two more hold fans, one open and one closed, to their mouths. Three women in the front row sit closely together and others turn or stand. The walls and possibly curtains of this space are luminous yellow, and a green palm-like tree is at the back of the room. The woman wearing black stands directly in front of the stage, one hand lifted and the other clasping her skirts as she leans toward the musicians. Her mouth is open, and she is harshly up-lit by the stage lights. Three men facing her hold a violin, upright bass, and perhaps a viola. Three more men closer to us face away so we only see the brown hair of one, the black top hat of another, and the straw-yellow bowler hat of the third. The stage space is enclosed opposite us with a wall streaked with kelly green, peacock blue, and charcoal gray. A three-lobed brass-colored light hangs or is affixed to the wall there. The artist signed the lower left, “Degas.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/aa3c8fb3-8d83-46e4-9cf1-6749f5b428c2/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

Shown from the lap up, she almost takes up the height of this vertical painting. She wears a voluminous, ice-blue chemise with elbow-length sleeves and a round, sapphire-blue earring in the ear we can see. Her head is tilted slightly back as she reaches up with both hands. With her right hand, closer to us, she holds the end of a chestnut-brown braid hanging over that shoulder. Her other elbow points upward as she touches hair at the base of the neck. Her lips and face are deeply flushed in her otherwise pale face. Her mouth hangs slightly open, revealing white teeth as her half-closed violet-colored eyes gaze off to our right. She sits in the corner of a room with wallpaper decorated in a pattern of tree limbs and leaves in cranberry red and slate blue on a mauve-pink background. A peanut-brown dresser behind her is covered with a white cloth on which sit a white cup and glass pitcher with a tapered neck. A white porcelain ewer and washbasin, tinged with blue, are partially visible behind her bent left elbow. The lower corner of a mirror in a bamboo frame hangs from the upper right. A portion of a burgundy rug fills the lower left corner.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/ab4c9497-a07d-4ea1-ae85-f0bd984ae36d/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The riverbank curves deeply like a backward capital letter B. Marshy grasses grow in tufts, and palm and other trees grow in a grove to our left. One brown-skinned person wearing only a white cloth around the hips carries a long stick near the shoreline. Dabs of brown and muted dark pink suggest other people farther along the riverside. Tree-covered boulders jut into the creek from our right. A band of rocky, mountains are smoky mauve-pink across the rightmost two-thirds of the horizon, which comes a third of the way up the composition. The butter-yellow sun is low on the horizon to our right, peeking through the grove of palm trees. The light pours across the placid surface of the creek, creating a soft yellow streak next to the reflection of the mountain ridge. A few heather-pink clouds drift across the pale turquoise sky. The artist signed and dated the painting in the lower left corner, “C. Pizarro. 1856. Paris.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/b1461d28-88d4-4aee-88dd-a78d368308ff/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The scene is loosely painted with visible, sometimes thick, brushstrokes mostly in tones of ivory white, sky, denim, and cobalt blue, and spring green. Much of the detail, especially in the people’s faces, is indistinct. The people all appear to have light, peach-colored skin. Three people sit along the steep riverbank, which is indicated with a triangle of asparagus and sage greens. The person to our left wears a marine-blue shirt and a navy-blue cap. The person at the center of this trio sits with their back to us, wearing a dark, plum-purple garment and cap. The third person, closest to us, sits with knees bent, facing the river, wearing a white shirt, black pants, and a navy-blue cap. A small patch of asparagus green farther up the left edge of the composition suggests that the riverbank extends into the distance, and a swipe of dark blue paint could be another person sitting there. The river is painted with horizontal, visible strokes of blue, pea green, tan, and a few touches of petal pink. Three people stand in the water near the bank. Two of them are bare-chested, and one is in the water up to the chin. The head and neck of a white horse wearing a dark bridle enters the scene in the lower right corner, presumably wading in the water. An area stretching across the right half of the composition on the far side of the river reads as trees, but is painted with criss-crossing strokes of moss green, azure blue, and a few touches of burgundy red. One sailboat near the trees and another farther out, to our left, are each created with a vertical stroke of white over a dark smudge to represent the boat. To our left of the trees, there are horizontal bands of pale, butter yellow, blush pink, and baby blue where the river meets the sky, about three-quarters of the way up the composition. The sky is painted with diagonal, criss-crossing strokes of pale mint green, ice blue, and shell pink.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/b1d434c3-f0d3-436b-9a76-a87f48ea4151/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The man’s torso is angled slightly to our right but his left leg crosses over his other knee so his legs angle toward us. He looks at us with silvery-blue eyes under gray brows. He has a wide nose, thin, pink lips set in line, and a square jaw. A pale area above his upper lip could be a closely cropped mustache. Wrinkles surround his eyes and line his cheeks and jawline. He wears black trousers and a maroon-red jacket with wide, black lapels and cuffs over an eggshell-white shirt and tie, which is pinned with a silver ball. His right elbow rests on the arm of the chair so his hand rests in his lap. He wears a gold ring on the pinky finger of his other hand, which wraps around the dog’s body. The dog faces and looks at us with gold-rimmed brown eyes, and the dog’s fur is highlighted with icy blue, suggesting a glossy coat. The man and dog sit on what appears to be a sand-brown rock in the general shape of a chair. Behind the man and far below, along the right edge of the canvas, the landscape plummets down to a bright blue body of water, which surrounds a flat-topped, rocky outcropping that comes up to the shoulder level of the man. A cylindrical structure with one window sits next to a line of trees atop the outcropping in the distance. The sky meets the water at the horizon, about a quarter of the way up the canvas, and deepens from arctic white around the outcropping and man to deep cobalt blue around the two gray clouds near the top corners of the painting. A streak of light angles from the cloud to our right down toward the man’s head. The painting is signed and dated at the front of the chair, under the man’s elbow, near the lower left corner: “Pour Chester Dale et Coco Mon Pape Innocent X de Velasquez Salvador Dalí 1958.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/b27de7b2-8b7a-4e1c-82cd-20af45d7a664/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

In this photograph, her face is angled to our right. She looks down, chin tucked back into her neck. She has deep-set eye sockets, a thin, blade-sharp nose, and her small mouth is closed, the corners downturned. Light from our left gleams off some of the surfaces, especially in the choppy hair and along the edge of her nose. A long diagonal ridge on the right side of her neck, our left, suggests a tendon stretching as she turns her head. Her neck acts as the sculpture's base.

The scene is loosely painted with visible, mostly vertical strokes, and most of the forms, clothing, and objects are outlined in cobalt blue. Sitting in a wooden, ladderback chair, the man’s body takes up the bottom right quadrant of the painting. His skin is painted pale turquoise. His face turns away from us so we see the tip of his nose and the lines of his cheek and double chin. He has short brown hair under his top hat. He holds a silver-topped cane in one hand, which rests in his lap. A glass with some clear liquid sits on the table in front of him, to our left.  A peanut-brown column spans the height of the painting just beyond him, near the right edge of the composition. Three women stand closely together in the near distance, in the upper left corner of the painting. At the front of the trio, a woman with a peach-colored face wears an indigo-blue mask over her eyes. A few swipes of paint indicate blond hair, possibly pulled up. She faces our right in profile and stands with her right hand, closer to us, planted on her hip. She wears a bubblegum-pink sleeveless top and form-fitting pants. The skin of her arm and the skin on the face of the woman standing just beyond her is a cream-white tinged with blue. That second woman faces our right in profile, and her blond hair is either short or also pulled up. A teal-green strap of a low-cut dress crosses over the shoulder we can see. A third woman stands in front of this pair, between them and the seated man. She faces away from us and wears a cotton candy-pink robe and hood that completely covers her body.

The flat bridge spans the width of the composition along the horizon, which comes a third of the way up the canvas. The sky above is filled with clouds painted in muted tones of cream white, pale blue, and a few touches of shell pink, which mirror the water below. Along the horizon, buildings with spires and towers stretch from our right about two-thirds of the way across the canvas. To our left, a cluster of several boats, tiny in scale, gather near the bridge. Closer, and to our right, three larger ferries are crowded with passengers who are represented by miniscule daubs of brightly colored paint, mostly in black, golden yellow, crimson red, sky and cobalt blue, and ivory white. These boats are painted in short, flat brushstrokes in bands of flame red and midnight blue. The artist signed and dated the work at the lower left: ""C.

Shown against a background of emerald green, he wears a black floppy cap and a blue garment that splits over his shoulder. A ruffle of white is visible at the wide neckline, and the sleeve of his right arm, which faces us, is black.

The scene is loosely painted with visible brushstrokes throughout. The woman sits with her body angled to our left, her legs stretched out in front of her. She turns her head to face us as she leans forward to rest her chin on one hand, with that elbow propped on her lap. She looks off to our left with dark eyes, and her coral-pink lips are parted. Her chestnut-brown hair is pulled up under a white bonnet, which is topped with a pink flower and a touch of black. A black ribbon tied around her neck hangs down her back. She wears a long-sleeved, full-skirted white dress, and swipes of yellow, blue, and brown could be shoes peeking out from the bottom hem. The unfolded fan she holds in her far hand is cream white along the center has rose pink to one side and indigo blue to the other. The boy leans against her torso, his legs coming toward us, and he looks out at us with dark eyes. His cheeks are flushed and his pink lips are closed. He has short blond hair with bangs under a short-brimmed, straw-yellow hat. His suit is baby blue with navy-blue swipes across the shoulders and a white streak at his neck, perhaps a neckerchief. There are dark bands at the cuffs and around his waist. The blue pants are rolled back over bare knees, and he wears gray socks and red and white shoes. A spindly tree trunk grows behind the woman’s back, and the grassy lawn nearly fills the painting. A bed of flowers with dark pink blossoms runs along the curving line of grass in the upper left corner. A chicken stands and looks at the pair, to our right. The bird has a vibrant red comb, buttercup-yellow, white, and dark brown feathers. Its feet are covered with white feathers.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/b580ff1e-a8d3-4361-b8c1-1bb6726cf2f9/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The scene is painted with long, loose brushstrokes, which are visible throughout. The muted orange and golden yellow fruit are outlined with blue, as is the woven basket in which they sit. The two cypress branches behind and to either side of the basket are painted with sky blue along the stems and long, bristly needles. The gloves sit one atop the other near the lower right corner, and the top glove has three brown stripes down the back.

The scene is loosely painted, especially in the sky and water. The lowest level of the building across from us is apricot orange. The second story is pale peach, and dormered windows cut into the gray and then brown rooflines above. The words “AS’ NICOLAS” are painted in gray near the top of the second level, and more letters on the level below are illegible. The roofline drops down a level where it meets the structure next to it, along the left edge of the canvas. Two women in long skirts stand at a darkened, open doorway near the front corner of the structure. A sign on the side of the building hangs from a horizontal arm over three men in and near a shallow boat, which is being propelled by a man who stands in the stern with a long stick. The street is so wet that it first appears to be a canal or river. It is only when we notice dashes of mauve, pale pink, and gray to our left that we realize the cobblestone road is flooded. A band of buildings with tan walls and black or red roofs spans the right two-thirds of the horizon, which comes about a quarter of the way up this composition. A grove of cinnamon-brown trees and some open structures could be a submerged park in the near distance. Two poles and some spindly trees to our right are reflected in the water. Dark forms around these areas could be more people. Pale blue and very pale pink whip together in the sky, suggesting churning clouds veiling the blue sky. The artist signed and dated the work in the lower left corner, “Sisley 72.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/b74f7de3-fb66-406b-80b9-3a8381097bf6/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The women are divided into pairs by a broad, gold, undulating brushstroke running down the middle of the ground they occupy. They are mostly nude, and three have long black hair while one has flame-red hair. To our left, the woman with red hair stands facing us, wearing a glittering, silver necklace as she gazes off to our right. She presses a white patch, perhaps the end of a loincloth, to her upper leg with both hands. Seated next to her is a woman with most of her body turned away from us. She leans over onto her left arm and turns her head over that shoulder to look down and off to our right. Both women to our right are seated close to each other, their shoulders overlapping. One woman wears a white cloth around the hip we can see, and the other wears knee-length breeches. They both look toward us. Beyond the women is what appears to be a stream running diagonally from the lower left to end in a small pool in the middle right. It transitions from muted oranges and green to smoky blue and gray. Opposite us, more orange ground is lined with dense groves of dark green trees that wind into the distance. A woman wearing a coral-colored hood and blue robe holds the arm of a child, and a black dog crouches at their feet. They stand near a slightly larger-than-life-sized topaz-blue statue of a standing woman with her elbows bent and arms raised. The sky beyond the trees is streaked and swirled with bright orange, yellow, and blue. The artist signed and dated the painting, along with the title, in the lower left corner, “Paul Gauguin 98 TE PAPE NAVE NAVE.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/b8cbb100-dee4-45de-b225-20dd379b5619/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

Beyond them, the deep, distant landscape has a brown horse, tiny in scale, headed for a city of stone buildings beneath a vivid blue sky filled with twisting white clouds. The people’s bodies are sinewy and elongated, and their skin is painted in tones of ivory white, warmed with peach highlights and streaked with deep gray shadows. At the center, a man with a white beard and white, curly hair lies back on the charcoal-gray rock with his knees bent and his shins splayed out. With his body angled away from us to our right, he holds the body of a long, silvery-gray snake in his left fist, on our right, down by his hip. The snake curves behind the man’s body and he grips the snake behind its head. The man has high cheekbones and sunken cheeks, and rolls his eyes up and back to look at the snake, whose wide-open mouth nearly touches his hair. To our left, a cleanshaven young man stands with his body facing us but he arches back, holding an arcing snake in his hands. The young man’s right hand, on our left, bends at the elbow so he can grasp the snake’s tail and his other arm stretches straight back, holding the snake’s body as it curls around so its fangs nearly reach the young man’s side. To our right, next to the older man, a second, dark-haired young man lies on the rocks with his head toward us. His feet are on the ground, so we look onto the tops of his thighs. He lies with one hand resting on the ground, overhead. Three people seem to float, feet dangling, alongside the right edge of the painting. The person closest to us looks onto the writhing people in profile, back to us. A second person just beyond also looks to our left. A third head turns the opposite direction and looks off to our right. In the distance, the golden-brown horse is angled away from us, one front leg raised, on a path that moves from behind the rocky outcropping to the far-off town. Nestled in a shallow valley, buildings in the town are mostly painted with rose pink and red walls and smoke-gray roofs.

The church façade is angled to our left, away from us. The main door and its surround takes up the center of the composition, where a rectangular door is set within nested, pointed arches that lead up to a narrow, tall, triangular gable. The point of that gable overlaps the round rose window, which is the same width as the portal surround below. Spires flank the central section and rise steeply off the top edge of the painting. The sky above is painted as a field of pale lapis blue. A few dabs of darker blue and green suggest people, tiny in scale, standing near the lower left corner.

Against a dark brown background, the man’s body is angled to our left, and he stares at us from the corners of his brown eyes. His eyebrows are drawn together, and his pink lips are set in a line. His round face is cleanshaven, and he has full, flushed cheeks and a double chin. His gray hair is brushed back off his forehead and curls in a furling row over each ear. His black, high-necked coat is densely decorated with loosely painted gold leaves and patterns around the collar and down the front. A gold, starburst-like medal hangs from a short ribbon striped in white and light blue amid the gold trim. The coat’s wide, scarlet-red cuffs are lined with gold buttons and are also decorated with gold trim. A froth of white lace nestles at his throat. The coat is buttoned over his chest and drapes open across his hips over a red garment, possibly a vest, also edged with gold decoration. The tail of his black coat hangs down under the arm of his chair, which has a curving, gold wood frame and crimson-red upholstery. The man’s left elbow, closer to us, rests on the arm of his chair, and that hand is tucked into the gap between buttons of his red garment. His other hand rests on the pine-green cloth covering the table in the lower left corner of the composition. He holds a folded piece of paper in that hand, which rests on more papers. The folded paper is painted with the words, “El Sor Dn Antonio Noriega Tesorero General F. Goya 1801.” There is more writing on the front of the tablecloth, but it is difficult to make out.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/b9d23370-fd60-4816-ac63-6974db1ce03f/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The people all appear to have light skin. The most defined person is the woman closest to us, shown from the knees up to the right of center. Her body is angled to our left, and her profile faces that direction. Dark eyelashes suggest her eyes are closed. She has a pointed nose, and her red lips are closed. Dark brown hair is pulled up into a large bun with a coral-pink flower tucked in at the back of her head. She grips opposite elbows at her waist, her arms close to her body. Her pink costume has a low-cut bodice with loops low over her shoulders and a flaring, knee-length tutu. She wears a black choker tied with a bow at the back of her neck and two black bands encircle her wrists. A touch of white at the ear we can see suggests a gold earring. To our right and cut off by the right edge of the painting, a man stands beyond the woman’s shoulder, in shadow as he looks onto the scene. His face is painted with taupe-gray strokes. His suit and top hat are black except for a narrow white collar at his neck. Beyond this pair and seen from the chest up between them, another woman in the same pink costume faces our right. A short distance from us to our left, a third ballerina stands facing away from us. The elephant-gray floor she stands on visually creates a vertical band up the left side of the composition. The rest of the space behind and around the man and dancers is painted loosely with shades of vibrant to muted greens, with a few dabs of pale pink. The painting has a narrow sand-brown border.

He faces our left, gazing at a broken tree trunk with a cluster of weeds growing near its roots. A small crucifix is thrust into the broken trunk. He holds a rock in his outstretched right hand, on our left. The lion crouches next to him with his eyebrows gathered low as he looks off to our left.

On the right is the craggy face of a cliff with tall, slender trees growing on its top slope. The path darkens as it passes the cliff and reaches the church to our left of center. In the far distance to the right of the cliff is a castle-like structure with square towers. Deep shadows around the man and lion and along the path are created with areas of densely spaced, black hatched lines, and unmarked areas create bright highlights.

All the people have pale skin shaded with smoke gray, and their necks, fingers, and limbs are elongated. At the top center of the painting Mary holds Jesus on her lap. Jesus is nude except for a white cloth wrapped around his middle. His body faces us as he looks off to our left. He has blond, curly hair and the pudgy features of a baby. He grasps the forefinger of Mary’s right hand, to our left, and his other hand rests by his side. Mary looks down at the baby with her head tilted to our right. One hand reaches around Jesus’s torso and the other arm is lifted, so he can hold her finger. She wears a white veil draped over chestnut-brown hair and a sapphire-blue cloak over a voluminous, rose-pink dress. A winged angel looks on to each side of this pair. Both angels have blond hair and delicate features. The angel to our left wears a parakeet-green robe and has ice-blue wings. That angel crosses arms over the chest, as the angel to our right holds hands together in prayer. The second angel wears shell white and has silvery-gray wings. Both are seen from the chest up from behind puffy, pale blue clouds. Above the angels, rows of ghostly winged baby heads are loosely painted with tones of ivory white and slate gray. They frame a golden glow that surrounds Mary’s head. At Mary’s feet are five more winged baby heads. In the bottom third of the painting, two women stand with their bodies facing inward, toward each other. They both have honey-brown hair, snub noses, and pointed chins. The woman to our left looks up at Mary with large, glistening eyes, her pale pink lips parted. She wears a canary-yellow robe over a topaz-blue, long-sleeved garment. One hand curves over the head of a lion standing in front of her, holding one end of a long palm frond that rests on her right shoulder, closer to us. Two curling lines on the lion’s forehead are the cursive Greek letters for Delta and Theta, which are the artist’s initials. The woman to our right looks down so we see her in profile. A gossamer-white veil covers her hair and drapes across her chest. She is enveloped in a shimmering, flame-red cloak.

Applied to five joined, vertical canvases, the design is anchored at the center by a vertical blue pillar encasing a vertical row of four flower-like forms. Flanking the central column to either side, flowers are arranged in four rows of five blooms. Each bloom is a single, flat color, created with four cut pieces of painted paper. The arrangement of the colors vary so the flowers do not create a rigid pattern, though it seems like a pattern at first glance. The flowers are separated by clove-like forms creating X-shapes at the corner of each bloom. A stylized face takes the place of one flower near the center of each panel. Each oval face, eyes, nose, and mouth are drawn with black lines. Column-like forms in royal blue encase the composition along the left and right edges, and a row flicks like inverted commas lines the top edge. The flicks over the left half are blue and the flicks over the right half are green. The artist signed and dated the work with blue paint at the bottom right: “HM 53 53.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/ba97c120-385d-4ffc-bf09-7712b65caf9f/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

Her hands rest in her lap, one in front of the other. The hand and forearm we can see is nickel gray. The light shines from our right, casting the back of her head into shadow.

The people all have light or tanned skin. At the center of the table opposite us, a man, Jesus, sits facing us with his left hand, to our right, touching his chest and his other hand raised with the thumb and index finger pointing upward. He has long, blond hair, dark brows, and his square jaw is cleanshaven. A piece of white drapery wraps over one shoulder so half of his chest is bare. His body is outlined with light but is transparent so we see the landscape beyond the table through him. Three men are spaced evenly, shoulder by shoulder, to each side of Jesus on the far side of the table. A pair of men sit at each narrow end, and two men sit on our side of the table, one to either side of Jesus. The men on our side kneel at the table, so presumably the rest do as well. They bow their heads low over their praying hands, which rest on the table. Ten of the men wear silvery-white robes. One man to our left wears a lapis-blue cloak and one to our right wears bumblebee yellow. Eight of the men have dark hair, three have gray hair, and one is blond. The table spans the width of the painting, with the short ends to each side receding sharply back in space so there is room for the men there. The parchment-white cloth covering the table is creased deeply where it had been folded. Two pieces of a round loaf of bread, torn in half, are to either side of Jesus near the edge of the table closer to us. A glass tumbler with red liquid sits near Jesus. The scene is lit from the landscape beyond the table, so the people are slightly backlit, and the shadows and the red glow from the glass extend toward us. A structure above the table is suggested by a floating form of interlocking, golden shapes, like an oversized honeycomb, to create a dome-like space. Coffee-brown areas at the upper corners of the painting suggest a ceiling, but the structure fades to transparency as it nears the table. A shimmering body of periwinkle-blue water stretches from behind the table to a row of low, gossamer-white, rocky mountains along the horizon in the distance. One empty, golden yellow rowboat floats in the water, seen past Jesus's left elbow, and a second, indigo-blue boat has been pulled onto a sandy shore to our left. The sky above is topaz blue around a warm, yellow glow emanating from Jesus. A few taupe and cream-white clouds float across the sky. The artist signed the painting in dark brown on the tablecloth in the lower right: “Gala Salvador Dali 1955.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/bc32f24c-0890-45ab-9331-aaa218f06de9/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

At the upper center, a muscular man, Apollo, sits on an earthen mound. His long curling hair falls around one bare shoulder. He strums a lyre with his right hand, on our left. In groups of four or five, men and women stand in conversation or lounge in repose around him. Faint cursive writing, added with pen, above most of their heads identify them. Around a spindly tree in the lower left are ""Plato,"" ""Plutrache,"" ""Plinio,"" and ""Cicero."" A bareheaded man, ""Luciano,"" writes as he looks up at ""Danto,"" ""Homero,"" and ""Virgilio"" to our left of Apollo. Immediately around Apollo are ""Clio,"" ""Euterpo,"" ""Melpomene,"" ""Erania,"" ""Terpischore,"" ""Polimia,"" and ""Talia."" Two women, reclining to each side of Apollo, are not labeled, and four tall trees grow up amid this group. To our right are ""Marcobaro,"" ""Seneca,"" and ""Pitagora"" around two more trees. Finally, ""Socrates,"" ""Ovidius,"" and ""Aristitolus"" gather along the right edge. The tops of the trees almost touch the top of the print. Five winged, baby-like cherubs, each holding leaf diadems in both hands, float between the tree canopies above. A piece of paper seems to be affixed to the doors below, at the bottom center of the composition. It reads, “RAPHAEL PINXIT IN VATICANO,” above a monogram with the conjoined initials “MAF.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/be0bb5ed-dd73-4e20-9c1c-74646e9af049/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The painting is done mostly with areas of mottled color outlined in delicate black lines. Shown from the knees up, the woman lies with her legs to our right, and her hips tipped forward so her body faces us. She looks at us with dark, almond-shaped eyes under thin, arched brows. Bangs gather across her forehead, and her dark hair seems to be pulled back. Her head is tipped to our right, and she has an upturned nose, smooth cheeks, a pointed chin, and her smiling coral-red lips are closed. She holds the back of her left hand to her cheek and props herself up on her other elbow. Her rounded breasts have rust orange-colored nipples, and the contours of her body are smooth. There is a patch of dark hair at her groin, and her legs are pressed together. The blue pillow she rests on overlaps a white cloth or second pillow. The rest of the background is painted a terracotta brown with loose brushstrokes, so the setting is undefined.

Both people have pale, peach-colored skin. The scene is loosely painted so many of the details are indistinct. The woman walks away from us, angled to our right so we see her right cheek and the tip of her straight nose. Her lips are parted, and her dark hair is pulled back into a bun under a silvery-gray hat that curves over her head. The long-sleeved bodice is embellished with swirling black lines across the back of the neck, down along the arms and backs of the shoulders, and around the bottom. Her full skirt has a short train that trails behind her along the dirt path. To our left, a man stands with his body angled toward the woman, and us. He has short, dark hair under a rounded, brimmed, gray cap. His long sideburns connect with his full beard and mustache. The eye we can see is a dab of pale blue paint, and he looks at the woman.  He wears a navy-blue jacket over a white, collared shirt and white bowtie, and charcoal-gray pants. He reaches his left hand, farther from us, toward the woman, and he holds a short stick or staff in his other hand. Strokes of white on the dirt path suggest dappled sunlight filtering through the trees, which fill the rest of the composition. Leaves are created with swipes of celery and sage green, and trunks with lines of dark brown. A few touches of baby blue at the top center of the painting suggest a patch of sky through the dense canopies.

The sky along the top edge of the canvas is turquoise but it quickly fades to rich, salmon pink and then to deep red along the horizon, which comes only a quarter of the way up the composition. Steel-gray clouds ripple across the width of the painting. Two sailboats float in the water in the far distance. The water is painted the same turquoise of the sky with some reflections of the deep pink and red. Close to us, water breaks around the jagged black rocks beyond the a strip of mustard-yellow and tan sand that lines the lowest edge of the canvas. The artist signed the work in dark red paint in the lower left corner: “G. Courbet.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/c0d7780f-d00d-4c01-b5f8-c138420d2340/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

She faces and looks at us. Her face and neck is a field of orchid purple. Her eyelids are covered in crescent-shaped areas of turquoise above small areas of arctic blue, overlaid over the whites of her eyes and iris. Her full lips are covered with bright scarlet red. Black shading picks out her arched eyebrows, her heavy-lidded eyes, the shadow under her nose, her smiling mouth, the hollows under her high cheekbones and at her temples, and the shadow her chin casts on her neck. She has a mole between her left nostril and the left corner of her mouth, on our right. Her short, wavy hair is swept up from her forehead and overlaid with a field of canary yellow over the black shading that indicates curls along the sides of her face and along the back of her neck. A pear-shaped area of turquoise alongside her neck to our right could be the collar of her shirt. The turquoise background is flecked with a few black vertical lines, especially near the left edge.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/c2bf7ca2-a938-40dc-9683-cfb274e59f82/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

Except for the outlines, the paint is put on in long, horizontal strokes to create patches of color. The unpainted canvas shows through in some areas, especially in the lower corners and up along the right edge. A few shapes could recall body parts, like curved shapes for breasts near the top and an angled line for an elbow.

Most of the composition is filled with broadly painted areas of sage, olive, moss, and lemon-lime green to create an impenetrable wall of plants and growth. An oval of slate-blue sky to the left of upper center is framed by plants that grow up and off the top corners of the painting. Small in scale and nestled back among the growth near the lower center, the animal to our right has black eyes that look at or toward us, a long nose, and gray around its mouth and eyes. It has triangular ears and its body, which extends to our right, is dark brown with a lifted tail. To our left, another smaller animal, perhaps a baby, is mostly obscured by a fern frond and grass. This animal has small black eyes and chestnut-brown and black fur. Three large, stylized flowers with fuchsia-pink centers and pale petals grow above the animals, to our left. An oversized white hyacinth grows to our right. A narrow, brick-red bird sits on a branch above the pink flowers, almost lost among the plants. The artist signed and dated the lower right corner, “Henri Julien Rousseau 1909.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/c6518c61-98bb-4759-9042-b4bc2ec343ef/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

Stone buildings of the town across the water beyond them are on fire, and the sky is filled with dark clouds. Closest to us, in the lower left corner of the composition, the two pale women lie, one in front of the other, nearly parallel to the bottom edge of the paper. Their heads are near the left edge and their feet reach halfway across the composition. The woman closer to us has her back to us, and her head is tipped back so we see her profile. The other woman’s body faces us. They both have long curly hair, and their eyes are closed. Their arms rest down the length of their bodies. Cloth is draped under their bodies and around the lower legs of the woman whose body faces us. Their torsos are propped up on rocky outcroppings, which rise behind the pair and echo the curving form of their bodies. The four fantasy creatures cluster on a flat area near the water, in the lower right corner. Each is made up of body parts from different animals. One to our left in that group has a sheep’s face, a body shaped like a caterpillar, seven insect-like legs, rounded fins or wings, and a cluster of stingers at the tail. Drool or something else drips from its mouth. At first glance, a creature on the lower right resembles a conch shell, but the opening is like bat’s head with oversized ears, and a protruding lower lip to make the shell’s opening. It rests on clawed feet. Closest to the water, a critter has a lizard’s head, which is folded back with gaping mouth open, over a slug-like body, and two paws with long claws. The final creature is hard to make sense of. It has a long neck, like a reading lamp, ending in a bird-like head. Its body looks like a second goat-like face, and the almond-shaped tail seems to come from the goat’s mouth. It stands on two clawed feet. A stone building rises up the left edge of the composition, behind the women. A band of water separates this bank from the town beyond, the buildings of which come to the water’s edge. To our right, rectangular and arched doorways and windows are backlit by flames, and smoke pours out of the upper stories. People shown as dark or light silhouettes clamber up stairs and carry others. In a nearby boat on the water, a person uses a pole to propel the vessel and the five smaller people, probably children, it holds. More people are in a longer boat farther back from us, in front of a complex of buildings with shallow rooflines or crenellations. A three-rayed flash emanates from a rocky hill between this complex and the burning building to our right.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/c75ea0d4-0732-4f4b-b78f-3e22e1a68607/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The people all have pale, peachy skin, blond hair, and translucent gold halos, and together they fill most of the space of this vertical painting. To our left, the woman perches on a pillow on a wooden chair as she holds the baby. The scrolling arm of the chair dips down to the seat in the lower left corner of the painting, and the black, scarlet-red, and gold pillow has a silver tassel dangling from the upper corner. The woman’s body is angled to our right, and she turns her head in profile to gaze down past the child with heavy-lidded eyes. Her forest-green cloak is lined with dark material where it turns back down the front. Short, cape-like drapery flutters across her shoulders and is decorated with gold bands along the hem. The cloak is held closed by a gold disk just below the neckline of the red gown underneath, which is belted with a thin gold band above the waist. Her hair is pulled back from her high forehead and is covered by a sheer white veil that frames her face and falls in folds to her shoulders. She steadies the plump baby so he is propped upright on her lap, facing her, with his feet resting on her belly. The baby reaches out to her with his right hand resting on her left shoulder, farther from us, while he turns to look up over his other shoulder, above us. A dove-gray cloth with rose-pink and white stripes is wrapped around his waist and drapes over his legs. To our right, the two angels stand with their bodies facing the child they help support. The angel closer to us turns back to look at or past us with brown eyes. That angel’s robe is rose red with a brighter, scarlet-red collar. The robe falls back to the elbow on the arm closer to us to reveal a cream-colored sleeve patterned with leaf-like strokes of pine green and earth brown. That hand is raised to delicately hold the hem of the baby’s wrap. The one wing we can see is brown and cranberry red, and is cut off by the right edge of the painting. The second angel stands at the back of the little group and looks up and off to our right with silver-gray eyes. That angel wears a pale lavender-gray robe and one hand supports the baby’s bottom. A small, scarlet-red disk is set into the angel’s hair over the forehead. A spray of white lilies angles from between the two angels along the right edge of the panel. The room the group occupies has light gray walls, some tinged with shell pink, and a sapphire-blue ceiling bordered with dark brown wood. A matching sapphire-blue, scalloped half-moon shape is set into the back wall. A garland of chestnut-brown leaves hangs from gold fittings to span the room near the ceiling. Portions of a stone building and watery blue sky are visible through the windows to either side and at the back of the room.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/c814fc4e-77aa-49b7-b1db-b2756d813731/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The back of the glove on her left arm, closer to her, is tied at the top with a bow, and she holds a silvery-white, closed fan in that hand. A brownish-coral colored necklace is painted as a squiggle of paint around her neck. Barely visible, the painter signed the painting in the lower left: “Goya.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/d0840afa-9aaf-49c0-8e2f-b3dff652bf2d/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

Yellow eyes gleaming, the tiger stretches its front paws forward with ears pinned back, teeth bared, rump in the air, and its tail curling down near its back legs. The white fur of the tiger’s underbelly near the front legs glows in the sunlight. Light glints off the skin of the snake, which coils around the tree twice and flicks its forked tongue between gaping jaws. The grassy area around the tiger is painted in shades of gold, green, and mustard yellow. Behind the tiger, a sage-green plain stretches back on our left to rocky hills in the distance, with hints of blue sky and clouds beyond. The tree frames the scene on our right, its gnarled, split trunk extending off the top edge of the canvas and its roots reaching beyond the bottom edge, where the artist signed and dated the work: “Eug. Delacroix 1862.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/d12d7b5d-6e51-4e5a-af84-e55067bffc51/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The woman’s features are elongated and simplified, and the nearly geometric forms are outlined with gray. Loose brushstrokes are visible throughout, creating a textured, mottled effect. The woman’s long, thin face comes to a point at her chin, and her brown hair is pulled back on either side of her forehead. She has pale blue eyes, an exaggeratedly long nose, noticeably flushed cheeks, and her coral-pink, bow lips are closed. Her white blouse has a wide, tomato-red, squared collar that lies over her shoulders, and a thin, light blue scarf drapes around her neck and down her chest. Her long, full skirt is blended shades of violet purple and sky blue. The woman’s hands are clasped around a baby wrapped in a navy-blue blanket. The baby’s head is covered with a long pink cap with black and white bands at each end. The woman casts a narrow shadow against the gray wall behind her. Bands of elephant gray, black, and brown behind her across the bottom of the composition suggest an abstracted bench or seat she sits on. The artist signed the work in dark letters near the upper left corner: “Modigliani.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/d32bd15e-3b9d-47d1-87d9-b2c509ae7e57/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

Three vertical drawings are spaced along the top half of the ivory-colored album page, and one larger horizontal drawing fills the bottom half. Drawn with brown ink and gray washes, the frames resemble moldings and scrolls around each drawing, with garlands flanking the bottom sketch. The three drawings in the top zone are done with metalpoint on gray or mauve paper and are highlighted with touches of white. The metalpoint technique creates faint silvery-gray lines. In the top left drawing, a nude man stands facing us. In the center, the face of a cleanshaven young man with curling hair beneath a cap looks down and to our left. Below the face, a forearm and hand clutching a rock appears next to another study of a hand. In the drawing to our right, a man wearing a toga-like robe leans on a walking stick, facing our left in profile. The drawing at the bottom is done with gray metalpoint lines and white strokes against golden yellow paper. A person sits and twists up in a spiral to our left. In the center of this drawing are three studies of muscular legs. Then, to our right, a man sits on a throne holding a spear or scepter and globe, facing our right in profile.

His nose is slightly bulbous, and his thin lips are tightly closed in a straight line. Wrinkles and jowls give his face a paunchy look. His tall, flat-topped, fez-shaped hat covers his hair. A white, nearly translucent collar curls up along his neck and flares out to points at his collar. Rose-pink highlights on his red cape suggest it is a shiny material, like silk, and it is fastened with several small, dark buttons down the front.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/da9c1054-627f-4caf-bbdc-4faf97a779a8/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

His hair is parted down the middle and is brushed down to meet his ears. He has an elongated neck, and his narrow shoulders slope down. He wears black pants and a black coat over a dark teal-green vest. A white shirt is visible along his neckline, and an area of black could be the knot of a tie. He holds the fingers of one hand in his other, both hands resting in his lap. A loosely painted, brown table sits next to the man to our right, and an area of slate blue and white could be a glass on the table. A vertical line in the background behind the man, to our right, probably indicates the corner of the room. The walls are painted with strokes of smoke gray, ocean blue, and some parchment white. The artist signed the work in dark letters in the upper right corner, “modigliani.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/dafde496-964f-4fa4-b50e-2efa9abd24a0/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

Both men have light skin, and they, along with the horse, nearly fill the composition. To our right, the bright white horse stands angled to our right with the front left hoof raised. It has a smoke-gray mane, and wears a black bridle. The man riding the horse has short, copper-blond hair and a long face with a pointed chin. He looks down at the ground with dark eyes under black, arched brows. He has a long, thin nose, and his small lips are closed and framed by the faint suggestion of a mustache. He wears a white ruff pleated into figure-eights over his high-necked armor, which is liberally outlined and decorated with gold against the pewter-colored plates. He grips the voluminous, green cape in one hand and holds a sword in the other, down by the leg we can see. The cleanshaven man next to him, to our left, looks off to our right in profile. He has close-cropped, dark hair and smooth skin. His lips are parted, and he tips his head slightly away from us. He holds the green cloth with the hand closer to the horse and gestures down with his other pointer finger, in front of his hip. A white cloth bandage is wrapped around one shin, and he rests his weight on the other leg. The horse and man stand on a curving spit of brown earth. A spring-green landscape dips down behind them, running low near the bottom edge of the painting. The horizon comes about a quarter of the way up the composition, and fog-gray and white clouds create thin screens across the topaz-blue sky. The loose brushstrokes are visible in some areas, especially in the landscape and clothing. The artist signed his name in Greek near the lower right corner.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/db862e1d-b007-4411-98bc-7460e9ea8dee/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

Both the woman and baby have light skin. The cradle is draped with a sky-blue, scallop-edged cloth decorated with pink flowers and green leaves. A curtain of the same material is tied above so it hangs down behind the head of the cradle from the top center of the composition. The baby’s dark eyes are wide open, and he seems to gaze ahead. His cheeks are flushed peach, and his coral-pink lips are pressed down in a crescent shape. The baby’s head is wrapped in a white hood with a royal-blue bow or decoration over the right ear, to our left. Two loosely painted, round, salmon-pink shapes on either side of the child suggest hands emerging from the under the white blanket. In his left fist, to our right, the baby holds a white drum on a pumpkin-orange stick, with red and white forms, possibly feathers, at the top. The dark green handle of a pinwheel lies across the baby’s legs in the cradle. Another green, vertical form overlapping the edge of the crib suggests that another toy is clipped or propped there. It is difficult to tell if the pinwheel in the crib has canary-yellow and mauve-pink blades or if there are two, overlapping toys. The woman sits with her back to us but is angled so we see her profile looking down at the baby. Her face is painted with broad strokes of sand brown and parchment white. Her dark hair is pulled back under a white cap, and she wears a charcoal-gray and black, vertically striped dress with a white collar. Her back rests against the slats of a wooden chair, which seems to dissolve into the loosely painted, fawn-brown area in the lower right corner. The cradle sits next to a bed, mostly cut off by the left edge of the painting, with a golden-brown blanket or cover. Eggshell-white cloth seems to hang around the bed and along the wall behind the woman. The scene is loosely painted with visible brushstrokes.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/dba8b352-d853-49c6-89b3-76035e17f15c/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The aquamarine blue and vibrant yellow along with lime green, lilac purple, oyster white, and teal used in the people and landscape give this work a shimmering look. A pair of people recline together under a tree in the lower right corner. A sheep stands nearby, and a bird perches in the tree above. Beyond the tree and to our left, a cluster of box-like forms suggests a city in the distance. Larger in scale, so seeming closer to us, a man wearing a lapis-blue toga and a yellow cap holds a stringed instrument, a lyre, in front of his body. To the left, at the center of the composition, a trio of women each wearing amethyst-purple, magenta-pink, or lapis-blue dresses stand close to each other. They have long, dark hair and their bodies and garments are outlined in black. Between them and the large sun to our left, a winged horse with a buttercup-yellow body and turquoise-blue wings rears up. Near the upper left corner, the stylized sun is represented by a disk surrounded by pointed peaks, surrounded by a larger disk outlined with another ring of triangular points. A winged person holding a set of pan pipes flies above the sun to our left, over a small crescent moon below. Near the lower left corner, two groups of people gather around a body of bright blue water occupied by two fish. The artist signed and dated the work in the lower right corner: “MArC ChAgAll 69.” The mosaic is displayed outside in front of a screen of trees, with a band of bushes with green and orange leaves below.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/dcfb5ed1-5a57-4546-93df-38635fffd9c9/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

His body faces us and he looks slightly off to our left, as if just over our left shoulder, with dark eyes. He has a wide nose, his pale pink lips are closed, and he has the hint of a five o’clock shadow on his square jaw and cleft chin. Sideburns come down past his ears, and straight brown hair falls in long bangs over his forehead and around his eyes and ears. White cloth wraps around his neck and is tied in a knot at the base of his throat. His white vest is striped faintly with light blue. Over that, his gray jacket has a black collar at the back and wide, gray lapels that reach his shoulders. The jacket is fitted to his waist, where it is buttoned, and then flares out into the shadows at his knees. Silver buttons gleam in the light from our left, down that side of the jacket. His left fist, on our right, rests against his hip as he leans on his other elbow, presumably on a ledge or high table. He holds the black top hat in that hand so we see the crimson-red lining within. The dark background behind him is subtly streaked with brick and coffee brown.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/de9503be-2d64-4e99-bb0d-c75601ade9d9/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

Together, the monochromatic plots create the impression of a patchwork quilt, with large areas of pale pink, butter yellow, bright white, and baby blue. A person walks across the plots to our right. The horizon line comes almost halfway up the painting and is lined with dark brown houses with tall, pitched roofs. Two barren trees twist into the cloudy sky. The loose, short, parallel brushstrokes and touches of paint create a soft, hazy effect.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/de9ed4a3-3aed-4e56-b4c0-8c64a6ca4cc5/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

All three people have gray complexions tinged with blue, are barefoot, and their features, clothing, and bodies are outlined. To our left, the woman’s back is to us, and her face is turned in profile to our right as she looks down at the ground. Her navy-blue, nearly black hair is pulled up in a loose bun. She wears a deep ocean-blue shawl over a long skirt that covers her entire body except for bare toes peeking out under the hem. The form of the shawl protrudes a bit on the right as if she holds her arm across her body. The slightly taller man stands across from her to our right with his body mirroring the woman’s. He crosses his arms tightly across his chest as he gazes down in profile. The eye we can see is deeply shadowed, and his hands are tucked into his elbows. He has a beard and short, dark hair with streaks of sky blue. His long, marine-blue shirt blends into his pants, which are cut off at the ankles. Unlike the woman, he stands with the weight on one foot, the other knee bent. To our right and in front of the man, the child stands facing our left in profile. He has short, dark hair, and he looks toward the woman. He touches or gestures near the man’s thigh with his right hand, farther from us, and holds his other out in front of his waist. His shawl has a reddish tint, which contrasts with his ankle-length, stone-blue pants. The trio stands on aquamarine-tinted sand before gentle waves along a shoreline. In the top third of painting, the sky is a block of celestial blue. The artist signed his name, “Picasso,” in a dark blue in the lower right corner and dated the painting, “1903” in the upper right.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/e09a5191-9b76-469e-8eca-4a97e81a7331/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The table comes into the scene from our left, and she faces it in profile facing our left. The table is covered with a cloth and comes up to her chest. She looks down into the bowl, which she tips toward her with the hand closer to us, and she holds a spoon inside, as if stirring, with the other. She has a high forehead, a snub nose, and a rounded chin. The vivid pink of her lips and cheeks and the tawny brown of her shoulder-length hair contrast with the icy blues of the rest of the picture. She wears a knee-length dress with a wide cloth wound around her neck with the ends trailing down her chest and back. Marine-blue socks come halfway up her otherwise bare calves, and she wears dark shoes. There are two more objects on the table: a mug, painted with a coral-orange and blue design, and a flax-yellow object that could be a piece of food. The girl's dress, the cloth around her neck, and the tablecloth are painted in shades of turquoise, sky, and cobalt blue. A brown wooden leg emerges from under the tablecloth. The floor around the girl is pale blue with a darker blue area indicating the shadow cast by the table. The shadow is streaked with a few lines of orange and light brown. Blue fields on the back wall behind the girl could be blue curtains next to a patch of brown wall, in the upper left corner. All of the objects and the girl’s features are outlined in royal blue. The artist signed the upper left corner, “Picasso.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/e19a2b28-639c-4d6a-848c-da253d5ee6b9/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The scene is painted with short, visible brushstrokes with a palette dominated by spring, pine, and celery green and earthy tan, peanut, and chestnut brown. Touches of canary yellow, pale pink, coral, and ruby red suggest sunflowers, roses, and other flowers. The woman wears a long, steel-gray skirt and a long-sleeved olive-green shirt. Her brown hair is bound up, and her face and hands, indicated with only a few short swipes of paint, are pale peach. She stoops over a light green patch to our right of center near a bundle of sticks or a group of tall dried stems, to our right. Leafy greens have been planted in rows to our left. Across from us, beyond the cultivated rows, masses of flowers grow in a band that nearly spans the width of the composition. Beyond, a gray stone house with a dark gray roof and a second brick red roof rise above the plants and trees. The pale blue sky above is dotted with cotton-white clouds. The artist signed and dated the work with dark paint in the lower left corner: “C. Pissarro 1989.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/e291058c-0769-493c-a5f3-8e0e64e9ea46/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

He looks to our right in profile and holds the hand of a little girl who also stands with her back to us. She wears a pink dress and white stockings, and her right hand rests on the tall handle of a white basket. A portly man wearing a scarlet-red jester’s costume and pointed hat stands opposite this pair, facing us to our right. Next to him to our right a young man wears a tan-colored leotard with a black bottom. He holds a barrel over his right shoulder and looks over to our right.

The straight deck of the bridge crosses the center of the composition but angles slightly away from us as it moves to our right. The four low arches of the bridge are painted with cotton candy pink and pale apricot. The sky above is painted loosely with light aquamarine blue and watery turquoise. A few vertical strokes of paint over the bridge suggests buildings along the riverbank beyond. The bridge is reflected in the water below so the blue, green, orange, and pink swirl together. The artist signed the painting in violet-purple letters in the lower right corner: “Claude Monet.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/e5c0853d-e3ac-49c2-884e-c0ac3b0af597/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

Though made with oil on cardboard, the paint is applied in thin strokes, so parts of the painting look more like a drawing, and the tan of the cardboard is visible in many areas. Shown from the thighs up at the center of the composition, the man stands with his back to us, looking away from us to our left, almost in profile. The camel-brown of the cardboard acts as the color of his jacket and the skin of his face, which are otherwise delineated with cobalt-blue and violet-purple lines. He wears a dark bowler hat, and a white cigarette dangles in his lips. A few scribbled black lines could suggest a mustache. Hands thrust into his pockets, he looks down at the bar, which a runs along left edge of the composition. Squeezed between the man and the glasses on the bar, a woman wearing a teal-blue feather boa leans one elbow on the bar and looks back at the man from the corners of her eyes. Her skin is rose-pink and she has curly red hair. Her arched, thin eyebrows and snub nose are set in a round face with a double chin, and her crimson-red lips are pursed. She wears a ruby-red dress or coat and a turquoise-blue, wide-brimmed hat with bubblegum-pink ribbons or feathers. Two small, stemmed glasses sit on the bar in front of the man and woman. Behind the bar, along the left edge of the painting, a man wears a dark vest over a shirt with sky-blue sleeves. A light cloth lies over the shoulder closer to us and he has dark hair. The rest of his features are lost behind the woman’s hat. To our right, beyond the man’s shoulder, a woman stands with her body facing us as she tips back and looks off to our right. She wears a long, black tie over a pale blue, high-necked shirt. One hand is tucked into a pocket on the front of her jacket, which is streaked with mint green over the brown cardboard. Loosely painted vertical stripes below her waist suggests she wears a skirt, indicating this is a woman, though it might otherwise be difficult to tell. She wears a low, royal-blue cap with an emerald-green feather curling up from the back over a cloud of yellow hair. Only the gray bowler hat, ruddy skin around the ear, and a teal-green jacket of a fifth person are visible between that woman and the right edge of the composition. The wall at the back of the space is tan with shell-pink streaks, and a sign with a red triangle against a turquoise background is cropped by the right edge of the painting. The scene is sketchily painted so features are outlined with blue or brown and filled in with streaks of pale color. The artist inscribed the painting in the lower right corner, “pour Metenier d'apres son Alfred la Guigne HTLautrec,” with the HTL overlapping to create a monogram.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/e7b14ecd-a748-4b2d-a774-98e25769da17/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The scene is created with fine, black lines built up in hatching and crosshatching to make deep shadows, and is printed on cream-white paper. The armored man rides toward our left in profile with a long lance resting on his right shoulder, farther from us, and the other hand holding the muscular horse’s reins. The lance extends off both sides of the paper and is wrapped with a fox’s tail near the top. The man’s face is wrinkled with deep-set eyes staring straight ahead. He has a prominent, bumped nose and wide mouth closed in a line, with the corner we can see pulled slightly up. The visor of his helmet is pushed up but his eyes are shielded from the creatures beyond the horse by the flaring sides of his helmet. Armor covers every inch of his body, including his hands and feet, and a long sword hangs at his left hip, closer to us. Spanning the width of the composition, his muscular horse walks with one front and one back leg raised and its chin pulled back, also looking straight ahead. A long-haired dog runs in the same direction between the horse’s feet over a lizard scrambling in the opposite direction. Seen between the armored man’s body and his horse’s head, the ghoulish creature at the side of the dirt path wears a spiky crown entwined with a snake and another serpent winds across his shoulders. The creature looks toward the armored man with round, piercing eyes, a hole where the nose should be, and a nearly toothless, gaping maw. He has a long, lanky beard and hair, and he holds up an hourglass topped with a clock-like dial. This creature also rides a horse, whose head hangs close to the ground. To our right, the goat-headed creature looks toward the armored rider with round eyes and its long snout slightly open to show fangs and teeth. Horns curl down to its shoulders and one long, sharp horn, dotted with spikes at the base, curves up and back over the creature’s face. It holds a double-pronged, spear-like halberd like a walking stick. Immediately beyond the group, rocky outcroppings push into the sky. The branches of barren trees and bushes are outlined against the blank, white sky and their craggy roots poke out of the rock. High on a hill in the deep distance is a castle complex or town. A plaque near a human skull resting on a tree stump in the lower left corner has the date of the print and the artist's monogram. ""S. 1513"" is followed by a ""D"" between the long legs of a capital ""A.""","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/e8308d3b-8495-4792-87c3-60276ef7f77e/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The horse’s front hooves are raised off the ground as it pushes off its back legs in mid-stride or leap. The horse’s chin is pulled back by the reins the man holds in his left hand, by his lap. The rider’s profile has a long nose, and his mouth is open over the suggestion of a beard. The rest of his face and head is covered by a fur cap. A long feather flows from the brim, over his right shoulder. That arm is raised as he holds up a whip. The shoulders of his long-sleeved, tight-fitting jacket are slashed, and there are four slashes creating a loose X shape on his mid-back. The leggings or pants on the leg we can see are vertically striped under a thigh-high boot, which folds over at the top. His pointed shoe hooks through the stirrup of the horse’s saddle, and a spur juts out from the heel. A sword hangs by the man’s left side, closer to us. The pair travel on a clear path lined on both sides with grasses, rocks, and trees. Closest to us, in the lower left corner, a smooth-topped, cut tree stump is surrounded by grasses and a few stalks. On the far side of the horse, a narrow grove of darkly shaded trees rises along the right edge of the composition, and the tallest tree extends off the top. In the distance to our left, steep, vertical cliffs and hills are engraved in lightly incised lines, so look more faint. Trees and structures are suggested with a few strokes. The topmost structures come about five-sixths of the way up the composition, and the sky above is blank white. The artist signed the lower center of the engraving with his monogram, an uppercase D tucked between the long legs of a wide uppercase A.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/ec50ec82-75e5-426e-a193-39b27b0fd955/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The bottom two-thirds is dominated by a black and white photograph of a woman and three lines of a single, large headline. To our left, the narrow, vertical portrait shows a smiling woman looking off to our left from the corners of her eyes. She has prominent, arching eyebrows and wears a white, possibly fuzzy hat over dark hair. The background behind her is charcoal gray. The largest text on the page fills the space next to her, to our right. It reads, “A BOY FOR MEG” in slanted letters. Under her portrait is the caption, “See Page 3” in small text. Moving to the top third of the painting: at the top left is a square portrait showing just the face of a man wearing a fedora, done in sky and royal blue. The caption under the portrait reads, “In the Magazine.” The headline that runs next to it has white text against ocean blue, and it reads, “Sinatra and his ‘Rat Pack’ TODAY: The Leader Himself (Con’t).” In the horizontal zone beneath the blue banner and above the portrait and headline about Meg, the title of the newspaper is the “New York Post.” To the left, a box reads, “WEATHER Fog tonight. in the 60s. Tomorrow: cloudy and warm, chance of showers.” In a box under the newspaper name, it reads, “NEW YORK, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 1961 10 Cents.” A secondary headline, to our right, reads, “LATEST STOCK PRICES Pages 85-88.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/edbfe342-3644-4ae7-a12b-890a4d4db9a4/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The woman takes up most of the composition as she sits with her right leg, to our left, tucked under her body. Her other leg, on our right, is bent so the foot rests on the ground, and that knee angles up and out to the side. She wears a rose-pink dress under a topaz-blue robe, and a finger between the pages of a closed book holds her place. Her brown hair is twisted away from her face. She has delicate features and her pink lips are closed. She looks and leans to our left around a nude young boy who half-sits and half-stands against her bent leg. The boy has blond hair and pudgy, toddler-like cheeks and body. The boy reaches his right hand, on our left, to grasp the tall, thin cross held by the second young boy, who sits on the ground next to the pair. This second boy has darker brown hair and wears a garment resembling animal fur. The boy kneels facing the woman and looks up at her and the blond boy. The trio sits on a flat, grassy area in front of a body of water painted light turquoise. Mountains in the deep distance are pale azure blue beneath a nearly clear blue sky.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/f033a552-2901-4c21-95ed-93d13e598632/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The women, trees, ground, and sky are all painted with long, parallel brushstrokes that curve and swirl over the canvas. The palette is dominated by sage and laurel green, tan and chocolate brown, spruce blue, and eggshell white. The women are outlined with dark brown lines. All three wear long skirts and long-sleeved shirts, and all reach for olives on the trees or into baskets. One woman, to our left, stands on the ladder and faces us; the second woman leans or sits against the right side of the ladder and faces away, her hair covered in a cloth; and the third woman stands at the foot of the ladder to our right, turning away from us. The tan and pale green of their clothing is echoed in trees around them. Short, distinct brushstrokes in pine and light green, with a few touches of silvery blue, create leaves on trees whose gnarled trunks are outlined with dark brown. The horizon line comes about a third of the way up the composition, and the sky above is painted with distinct strokes of ivory, pale mint green, and a few touches of shell pink. The ground around the women and trees is painted with sage and celery green, slate blue, and brown. The brushstrokes are spaced far enough apart in places that bare canvas is visible underneath, especially in the ground.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/f07617e8-43ad-4954-8223-4b40dce37061/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

Two long, low boats, gondolas, are pulled up side-by-side to one of the arched openings at the water level of the canal, to our right. A few touches of amethyst purple and mauve pink delineate some of the architectural features and shadows amid a field of denim and pale blue. The water below is painted with short, horizontal strokes to create a shimmering effect. The building’s reflection is captured with touches of emerald and cool green against the blue water.

The lilac-purple tabletop has round forms representing fruit scattered around a potted plant. Many of the forms are outlined with gray and filled in with mostly flat areas of color in mint and sage green, icy blue, coral red, orange, and lemon yellow. The tabletop curves around its edges and the surface is vivid purple, while the skirt and legs of the table are pale ginger brown. The woman’s head rests facing us on her bent right arm, that hand dangling over the front edge of the table. She rests her other hand, closer to us, near the crook of her elbow. She wears a white, blousy top with rows of navy-blue zigzags on the shoulder and elongated dots on the sleeves, and a light, mint-green skirt. Her brown hair seems to be pulled back and gathered into bunches of curving waves. Her stylized eyes, nose, and mouth are drawn simply with gray lines. The round orange, peach, and yellow fruit on the table are scattered near her arm and across the table to the other side, close to a plant in a brown clay pot. The plant has shoots of long, curving stems with vibrant spruce-green leaves. Two more plants are behind the woman near the back wall, in front a rectangular opening over the woman that could be a window or mirror. The glass is painted with streaks of baby blue and pale magenta pink around a field of white, and is outlined with a band of sunshine yellow and then scarlet red. The wall around it is also painted with watercolor-like, soft fields of pale blue and pink. The floor under the table and to our left is a flat field of caramel brown. Behind the table and to our left, forms suggest a wooden chair and a blue and white ceramic pot on a tall, spindly stand. In the lower left corner of the canvas, the artist signed and dated the work with dark red paint: “40 Henri Matisse.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/f3963d74-6a06-4763-b2f1-dcfcd801a5f8/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

At the bottom center of the composition, the closest girl has her back to us and wears a blue and white striped shirt over a long skirt painted with a blend of muted red and yellow strokes. A blue apron covers most of the front of her legs, and at least one black shoe emerges from the bottom hem, resting in the grass. Her brown hair is pulled up and covered by a red and white-checked cap. She looks toward her companion to our right, who turns her head over her left shoulder, her body facing our left in profile. The second girl has dark blond hair covered with a yellow kerchief speckled with daubs of dark red. She wears a peanut-brown shirt and skirt, and her legs are also mostly covered in a blue apron. The field is bordered by a line of slender tree trunks on the left and tall, dense hedges on the right. A light brown cow and a white cow stand in the field a short distance away. The grass is painted with tightly packed strokes of celery, pine, and kelly green with flecks of goldenrod yellow. Farther in the distance, a narrow band of silvery water enters from the left and runs across the canvas. Another field lies beyond it with a cluster of low buildings in the far distance on the right side. The artist signed and dated the lower right corner, “C. Pissarro 1882.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/f722edfb-50df-4e71-8e89-a2ad2a7f524d/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

Dashes of muted blue, fern green, and tan create the rippling surface of the river, which fills most of the bottom half of the painting. A dark tugboat chugs out of the scene near the bottom center of the composition, and the other vessels create diagonals along the river, angled down toward the bottom right corner. Closer to us in the lower left corner of the painting, a platform edge with a railing juts out to or over the water. At least six people stand on the platform alone or in pairs. They are loosely painted with touches of black, gray, yellow, plum purple, and peach. The platform itself is painted with swipes of sky blue, oatmeal brown, butter yellow, and rose pink. Each person creates a reflection in the surface of the platform, suggesting it is wet, perhaps with rain. The spiky branches of a row of trees along the far side of the platform are sharp against the landscape beyond. The buildings on the far bank are several stories high and lined with windows. Buildings farther in the distance have triangular rooflines or domes, which become slate blue along the hazy horizon. An arched bridge with a flat deck spans the river about halfway back along the river as we see it. In the top half of the picture, fog-gray and cream-white clouds fill the sky with patches of hazy powder blue showing through. The artist signed and dated the painting in sable brown in the lower left corner, “C. Pissarro. 1900.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/f7896300-10dd-4eec-ae25-bf689ce99015/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

He rests his head in his left hand, to our right, with the first two fingers extended along his temple. His blond hair is carefully combed, and he has arched eyebrows, bags under his eyes, a wide nose, and a bristle mustache over his square, cleft chin. He wears a navy-blue suit jacket over a white button-down and dark tie. The jacket has a white pocket square and a red flower on one lapel. The man wears a red pinky ring on the hand by his face. The other arm is extended so that hand, which holds a cigarette, hangs beyond the edge of the tabletop. We look slightly down onto the desk where a pair of glasses rests on an open book, which shows a self portrait by Van Gogh. A pamphlet partially tucked under one corner of the book would read, in full, “FRENCH PAINTING from the CHESTER DALE COLLECTION.” The man sits in a high-backed chair with cushion mottled with amethyst purple and topaz blue. Close behind him, a shelf to our right holds a copper-green mask and a figurine. Pale green paneling and drawers fill the left two-thirds of the background. The painting is inscribed at the top left, “To my very dear friend Chester Dale Diego Rivera. August 1945.” Brushstrokes are visible in some areas, especially in the background and chair.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/f8a0c85d-7cfa-4e63-aeea-d67f99ea9a28/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

Shown against a black background, the man tilts his head to our left and his eyes cut to our right. His left eyebrow, on our right, is slightly arched over brown eyes. He has a long, straight nose, pale pink lips, and his hair falls down the sides of his face from beneath a crimson-red, flat-topped cap. He wears a brown garment with white linen peeking through at the shoulder seams. The neck and seam down the front are lined with white, perhaps fur.

Some of the forms are outlined in black. Two dots and a curving line read as a modern smiley face on the person’s head, but a circle to our left and a tall, long oval to our right could be the eyes. The tall oval has short, cilia-like rays at the top and bottom, perhaps eyelashes. Pointed triangles along the bottom of the head area could be a beard or mustache. A shallow, upside-down, black U over the head is filled in with slate blue, and is presumably a hat. Areas on the torso have black grids creating diamond patterns against tomato red or bright yellow. Another area has vertical red and yellow dashes against a black background. Together they read as a diamond-patterned costume. The guitar is held vertically on the lap. It has an oversized neck vertically striped with black and white, an orange body with slivers of white to our left and black to our right. One hand holds the guitar near the tuning pegs and the other, represented with three wavy lines for fingers, touches the strings below. The chair behind the musician is grass green, and has curving sides and scrolling arms. The background behind the chair has vertical petal-pink and ocean-blue rectangles, against a wall that is off white above and rust brown below. The two zones of the wall are separated by a band with a Greek key pattern in charcoal gray and black. The artist signed and dated the top left corner, “Picasso 24.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/fd6be7a0-d2a1-4169-beb3-661acb416ad5/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

They all have light skin and brown or dark blond hair. The studio is lit from the left, and more light pours in through two windows toward the back. The wall closest to us is mint green with brown wainscoting covering the lower half, and a small mirror hanging a short distance down the wall. The walls of the space farther from us and the scuffed, worn floor are both painted with tan layered with washes of moss green and denim blue. A dancer in the lower left faces us and sits near a cello lying on the floor. The instrument’s curved upper body and neck emerge from the tutu near her left hip, on our right. She leans forward with her right arm, on our left, draped across her lap, and she rests her head on the other hand, propped up on her elbow. We look slightly down on her so only see the top of her head and the point of her nose. She wears a red jacket with her ice-blue, knee-length tutu spread around her. Her splayed feet are cropped by the bottom edge of the canvas. In the center are two dancers, one seated and the other standing. The seated girl is perched on a wooden chair with the back of her tutu draped over its top. She also wears a petal-pink jacket dotted with darker mauve. She gazes at the girl in front of her. That girl stands with her back to us, bowing her head slightly as she adjusts the bow of her emerald-green belt at the small of her back. At least six more dancers sit or stand along the far wall, in the upper right corner of the composition. One looks down at her tutu spread wide between her hands, and another holds a canary-yellow fan up to her face. The features of this group are loosely painted, making them indistinct.

One woman faces us and balances a flat tray loaded with white cloths on her head. Her left hand, on our right, holds the tray steady. The apron or loose, long skirt of her off-white dress is bunched up around her hips, but the fabric still falls to her ankles. A dark green, red, and brown scarf covering her head is tied in a knot by one ear, and the ends fall in front of that shoulder. The other woman stands in front of the first, to our left with her back to us. She wears an aquamarine-blue dress and garnet-red scarf tied around her head. A brown basket hangs from her left arm. The path angles from the lower right corner and cuts into the distance to our left. It is lined with brown and green bushes and grasses. An expanse of dirt to our right reaches to the shoreline, which curves like a C into the distance. Dabs of brown and dark pink suggest several more people standing or stooping in the surf in the distance. Shallowly sloping rust-brown hill cut into the water, spanning left two-thirds of the width of the composition along the horizon. The sky in the top half of the composition is a clear, milky white. The artist signed and dated the lower left corner, “C.Pizarro. Paris 1856.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/fdfa01c4-7334-4a34-a1fa-64429773e96e/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

The scene is painted with mostly flat areas of color. Closest to us, low, vibrant green pastures are bisected by a narrow, gingerbread-brown path. The path meanders from the lower left corner of the composition to a metal gate, near the right edge of the painting. A short distance from us to our left, a man wearing navy-blue pants, shirt, and hat walks along the top of a hill, hands in pockets. Two black and white cows and one brown and white cow graze nearby. In the distance, the copse of trees is painted with pockets of pumpkin orange, lavender purple, sky blue, and spring and muted sage green. Beyond the trees, a white, square, two-story house with a spruce-blue roof sits within the grouping of buildings. Another white building with a blue roof stands a bit to our right. Wisps of white clouds dot a vivid blue sky, which is tinted with pale pink and lilac purple near the horizon. The artist signed and dated the work in harvest yellow against a mound of dark brown rocks in the lower right corner: “P. Gauguin 90.”","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/ff6189ad-1385-4bc5-b63e-6a568a7288aa/full/600,/0/default.jpg"

A scroll with the Latin words “VIRTVUTEM FORMA DECORAT” weaves around and across the circle made by the branches near the bottom of the composition. The laurel has slightly serrated, oblong leaves that come to a point at either end. The palm has closely packed, narrow leaves that flare out like a feather to our right. The laurel, palm, and delicate twig of juniper are cut off near the bottom edge, where there is an area of flat brown that rises like a mound at the middle and tapers to each side. The rest of the background is dark brown speckled with rose pink, and a crimson-red, round seal is pressed into the top right corner.","https://api.nga.gov/iiif/ff62e8d0-45c4-498f-ad36-6358de827e04/full/600,/0/default.jpg"
