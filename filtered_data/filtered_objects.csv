[1] José M. Pita Andrade, ""Los cuadros de Velázquez y Mazo que poseyó el séptimo Marques del Carpio,"" _Archivo Español de Arte_ 25 (1952): 227, identifies the painting as a work listed in the 1651 inventory of Haro y Guzmán.



[2] Several conflicting dates have been published regarding Count Harrach's acquisition of this painting. Walter W. S. Cook, ""Spanish Paintings in the National Gallery of Art,"" _Gazette des Beaux-Arts_, XXVIII (1945): 79, said that the portrait was ""acquired in 1677 in Madrid,"" while José López-Rey, _Velázquez. A Catalogue Raisonné of His Oeuvre_, (London, 1963): 316, stated that it was purchased in 1687.  José Gudiol, _Velázquez_ (1974): 150, suggested that Count Harrach bought the painting in 1687.  In his 1926 catalogue for the Harrach collection (_Katalog der Erlaucht Gräflich Harrach'schen Gemäldegalerie in Wien_), Hermann Ritschl noted that Count Harrach mentioned the painting in a 1690 document as ""ein Contrefait, Bruckstück von einem Mann im grauen Wamms mit dunklen Ermeln, kleinen Überschlag mit Spitzen, von Velasca.""



[3] See entry from the David Finley notebook, as well as the 30 May 1988 letter from Dr. Robert Keyszelitz of the Gallerie Harrach (both in NGA curatorial files).  Although the Finley entry identifies the owner as ""Harrach (Count Johann von H.),"" Keyszelitz states in his letter that when the painting was sold to Duveen's in 1930, Count Otto Harrach was the head of the family.  Upon his death in 1935, his son Count Johann inherited this position.

[1]  The inventory of El Greco's estate made in 1614 includes the following item: ""Un S. ilefonso escribiendo"" (""A Saint Ildefonso writing""); see Francisco de Borja de San Román y Fernández, _El Greco en Toledo_, Madrid, 1910: 193.

[2]  The painting is listed in the inventory of 1621 as follows: ""Un san Ylefonso bestido de cardenal escribiendo, de bara y terzia de alto y casi un bara de ancho, con quadro dorado"" (""A Saint Ildefonso dressed as a Cardinal writing, a _vara_ and a third in height and almost a _vara_ in width, with a gilded frame""); see Francisco de Borja de San Román y Fernández, ""De la vida del Greco,"" _Archivo Español de Arte y Arqueologia_ 3 (1927): 70, n. 15.  A _vara_, a traditional Spanish measurement, equals about 84 cm. Thus, the painting was said to be 112 cm tall and almost 84 cm wide.  

[3]  _Relación del magestuoso recibimiento y entretenido cortejo de una fiesta de toros celebrada en honor de Carlos II y su esposa en Burguillos en una casa de recreación de D. Juan Varela Colima, secretario de S. M. y recaudador de los servicios de millones de Toledo y su partido...3 de junio de 1698_, Madrid, 1698. The relevant passage is transcribed in Francisco J. Sánchez Cantón, _Fuentes para la historia del arte español_, 5 vols., Seville and Madrid, 1923-1941: 5:509-510. The presentation is described as follows: ""A la Reina se ofrecieron doce albanicas de láminas primorísimas y al Rey una pintura de vara y media de alto, original del célebre Dominico Greco, que representaba a San Ildefonso con nuestra Señora, objectos predeilectísimos de la devoción de Carlos II..."" (""To the Queen were presented twelve fans with exquisitely decorated blades and to the King a painting a _vara_ and one-half in height [i.e., about 126 cm tall], an original by the celebrated Dominico Greco, which depicts San Ildefonso with Our Lady, favored objects of devotion of Carlos II...""). The NGA painting is the only work by El Greco or his workshop which corresponds to this description. 

The painting is listed in the inventory of the collection at the Palacio Real, Madrid, made between 1701 and 1703, as follows:  ""Ytten otro lienzo de Vara y Quartta de altto y bara de Ancho poco mas de Un San Yldefonso escribiendo delantte de Una Ymagen de nuestra Señora y Un Retratto en el mismo lienzo del Griego todo tasado en treinto Doblones"" (""And another painting one _vara_ and a quarter in height [i.e. c. 105 cm] and a little more than one _vara_ wide [i.e., c. 84 cm] of a Saint Ildefonso writing in front of an image of Our Lady and a portrait in the same painting [frame?] by Greco all valued at 30 _doblones_""); see  _Inventarios reales: Testamentario del Rey Carlos II_, ed. by Gloria Fernández Bayton, 6 vols., Madrid, 1975-: 1(1701-1703):31, no. 130. 
     
This entry seems to refer to two separate paintings which had been enframed together. Double enframing was not common, but it was sometimes utilized in the collection of paintings at the Palacio Real in Madrid.  Among the 1,067 entries in the 1701-1703 inventory of the Madrid palace, there are five additional references to other small works enframed together.  

It is impossible to know what portrait was enframed with _Ildefonso_; the portrait might be a now-lost work. Nevertheless it is tempting to posit that the _Ildefonso_ was displayed with Greco's portrait of a Dominican or Trinitarian monk (now in the Prado). This is one of the few portraits by El Greco or his school that could be combined with the _Ildefonso_ without significantly exceeding the measurements given in the 1701-1703 inventory.  Because the subject of this portrait is a monk, the combination of this painting with the _Ildefonso_ would accord with the practice otherwise followed in the royal collection of jointly enframing thematically related works. 

[4] Manuel B. Cossío, _El Greco_, Madrid, 1908: 598-599, no. 299; and August L. Mayer, _Domenico Theotocopuli, El Greco_, Munich, 1926: 46, no. 287, maintained that Zacharie Astruc purchased the painting in Madrid and imported it to France. This is not possible if the painting was in the Condesa de Quinto's sale because Astruc made his first trip to Spain in 1864. See Sharon Fletcher, _Zacharie Astruc: Critic, Artist and Japoniste_, Ph.D. dissertation, Columbia University, New York, 1977 (published in the series, Outstanding Dissertations in the Fine Arts, New York, 1978): 305.

[8] In the 1990 NGA systematic catalogue (Jonathan Brown and Richard G.

[1] Harold E. Wethey, _El Greco and his School_ 2 (Princeton, 1962): 247, no. X-401, identifies the NGA _Saint Martin and the Beggar_ as the one sold as part of the Baron Taylor collection.  The only information provided in the sale catalogue for lot 22 is the title and artist (El Greco). It is therefore impossible to identify which of the five small versions of _St. Martin and the Beggar_ was sold at the 1880 auction.  August L. Mayer, ""_St. Martin and the Beggar_ by El Greco,"" _Apollo_ 10 (1929):151 claims the the number ""387"" inscribed at the lower right indicates that the NGA painting was once in the Spanish royal collection, but he does not provide any evidence to support this assertion. The number 387 is not used to identify a painting of Saint Martin or a work of any subject by El Greco in the published inventories of the Spanish collections. The unpublished inventories of the Spanish royal collections have not been checked.



[2] Manuel B. Cossío, _El Greco_ (Madrid, 1908): 600, no.  309.  It seems likely that this is the painting listed as ""_Portrait_ (perhaps _San Luis_)"" in the collection of M. L. Manzi, Paris, by George C. Williamson, ed., _Bryan's Dictionary of Painters and Engravers_, 5 vols. (London, 1903-1905), 5:168.

Mayer, _Domenico Theotocopuli, El Greco_ (Munich, 1926): 48, no. 299, claims that the painting was included in the auctions of the Manzi collection. However, it is not mentioned in the catalogues of the auctions of paintings from the Manzi collection held at Galérie Manzi, Joyant et Compagnie, Paris, 13-14 March 1919 and 13 December 1919, nor is it mentioned in contemporary articles on these auctions. See, e.g., Alexandre Arsene, ""Les collections Manzi,"" _Les Arts_ 5 (1919): 1-26.  It seems possible that the brothers Bernheim-Jeune purchased the painting from (Manzi, Joyant et Cie)--with which Louis Manzi was affiliated--sometime before 1919.

For the various rooms at Stowe in which the _Venus Blindfolding Cupid_ is recorded, see Shapley 1979, 1:505-506 n. 4, and the correspondence from Colin Anson in NGA curatorial files.

[1] From the coat-of-arms at the lower left, there would seem to be little doubt that the Gallery's panel was first owned and probably executed for a member of the Haller family of Nuremberg; see Otto Titan von Hefner and Gustav Adelbert Seyler, _die Wappen des bayerischen Adels. J. Siebmacher's grosses Wappenbuch_. 34 vols. (Neustadt an der Aisch, 1971) 22: 38, pl. 36, and additional information in NGA manuscript for systematic catalogue number 5 on German painting, entry on _Madonna and Child_ by Dürer.  The Hallers were one of Nuremberg's largest and most influential patrician families, but our inability to identify the coat-of-arms at the lower right renders it all but impossible to find a candidate.  The direction of the Haller arms is reversed so that it may ""respect"" the arms of what is presumed to be the wife's family at the lower right; see Gustav A. Seyler, ""die Orientirung der Wappen"", _Geschichte der Heraldik. J. Siebmacher's grosses Wappenbuch_. vols. A-G (Neustadt an der Aisch, 1970) A: 454-487, and letter of 16 April 1988 from Walter Angst to John Hand in NGA curatorial file.  Anzelewsky raised the possibility that the panel was painted for Wilhelm Haller (d. 1534) whose second marriage to Dorothea Landauer took place in 1497; see Fedja Anzelewsky, _Albrecht Dürer Das malerische Werk_. (Berlin, 1971), 142.  On the other hand, Sally E. Mansfield suggested, in a report in the NGA curatorial file, Hieronymus II Haller (d. 1519) who married Catharina Wolf von Wolfstal in 1419.

""Von einem unberkannten sehr alten Meister. N. 239 Lot eilet mit seinen Töchtern aus Sodom. Man siehet unter andern auch ein Marienbild angebracht. Auf Holz."" Listed as belonging to the ""Praunisches Museum."" The suggestion, which remains unverified, that this refers to the Gallery's painting was first made by Erika Tietze, letter of 4 February 1953 to Fern Rusk Shapley, in curatorial files. In Murr's later catalogue of the collection, however, the painting is given to Joachim Patinir. See Christophe Theophile de Murr, _Description du Cabinet de Monsieur Paul de Praun a Nuremberg_ (Nuremberg, 1797), 31, ""Joachim Patenier, 239. Lot et ses deux Filles sortans de Sodome. Les figures sont comme decoupées, sans justes ombres. Sur bois. Albret Durer reçut ce petit Tableau en 1521 à Anvers par le Sécretaire de cette Ville... haut 8 p. larg. 8 p."" The Dimensions in _pouces_, approximately 8x8 inches, do not correspond to those of the Gallery's panel, and a verso is not described, suggesting that a different painting had been assigned the same catalogue number. The Praun collection was dispersed in sales of 1797 and 1802; see Th. Hampe, ""Kunstfreunde im alten Nürnberg und ihre Sammlungen,"" _Festschrift des Vereins für Geschichte der Stadt Nürnberg zur Feier seines 25 jähr. Bestehens_ (Nuremberg, 1903), 82-87.  Colin Eisler, _Paintings from the Samuel H. Kress Collection: European Schools Excluding Italian_ (Oxford, 1977), 14, listed Willibald Imhoff the Elder [d.1580] of Nuremberg as a possible owner.  Although there are several images of the Madonna or of the burning of Sodom and Gomorrah listed in the Imhoff inverntories, they are not, however, conjoined or described in enough detail to permit identification with the Gallery's picture. By the same token, it is not possible to verify the interesting suggestion in Eisler 1977, 16, n. 46, that the Gallery's panel might be the ""Marienbild von Albrecht Dürer"" belonging to both the Imhoff and Praun collections. See Joseph Heller, _Das Leben und die Werke Albrecht Dürer's_ (Bamberg, 1827) vol. 2, part 1, 78, no. 1 (Imhoff), 230-231, no. y (Praun). There is also some question as to whether the many works listed as by Dürer in the Imhoff collection were autograph or deliberate falsification; see Moriz Thausing, _Dürer, Geschichte seines Lebens und seiner Kunst_ (Leipzig, 1876), 141-144 (Engl. trans. _Albert Dürer, His Life and Works_. Fred A. Eaton Ed., 2 vols., London 1882, 1: 184-188).



[3] This and the preceding are unverified, but are first cited in Max J. Friedländer, ""Eine Unbekannte Dürer-Madonna."" _Pantheon_ 14 (1934): 322, who states that Loder purchased the painting from à Court Repington, repeated in Rudolf Heinemann, _Stiftung Sammlung Schloss Rohoncz. I. Teil. Verzeichnis der Gemälde_. (Lugano-Castagnola, 1937), 47, no. 127, and accepted by later authors. For Charles à Court Repington see the article by J.E. Edmonds, _The Dictionary of National Biography_ (Oxford and London), Supplement 1922-1930, 717-718. That he dealt in pictures on occasion is stated in Mary Repington, _Thanks for the Memory_ (London, 1938), 223, 278. No information has come to light concerning Phyllis Loder. There is no justification for the assertation in Denys Sutton, ""Robert Langton Douglas. Part IV,"" _Apollo_ CX, no. 209 (July, 1979): 205, that the picture was once owned by Robert Langton Douglas.

A note in the NGA provenance card file suggests that the panel passed from Vaz Dias to the dealer Bottenwieser in Berlin, but it has not been possible to verify this.

[1] The painting is probably the same one owned by the Madrid collector, Serafín García de la Huerta, who died on 25 August 1839.  In the inventory of his collection compiled in 1840, there is a picture described as follows: ""no. 859--Otro (lienzo) de una señora con mantilla y basquiña, de Goya, de cinco cuartas de alto por tres y media de ancho, en dos mil reales"" (""Another [canvas] of a lady with mantilla and basquiña, by Goya, measuring five cuartas high by three and a half wide"").  Although the vertical and horizontal dimensions are about five centimeters smaller each than those of no. 1963.4.2, this is an acceptable margin of difference, given the correspondence of the subject's attire with the description in the inventory (the discrepancy may be the result of including the dimensions of the frame).  For the inventory, see Marqués del Saltillo, ""Colleciones madrileñas de pinturas: la de D. Serafín García de la Huerta,"" _Arte Español_ 18 (1950-51): 204.  The association of García de la Huerta's painting with the one in the NGA is made by Xavier Desparmet Fitz-Gerald, _L'Oeuvre peint de Goya_, 2 vols. (Paris, 1928-1950), 2:168-169, who mistakenly gives the date of sale as 1850. [2] Charles Yriarte, _Goya, sa biographie et le catalogue de l'oeuvre_ (Paris, 1867): 138, lists the owner as the Marqués de Heredia. [3] According to Conde de la Viñaza, _Goya, su tiempo, su vida, sus obras_ (Madrid, 1887): 265, Garriga was then the owner of the picture.  Desparmet Fitz-Gerald 1928-1950, 2:168, notes without supporting evidence that Garriga acquired the painting in 1868. [4] Information on the acquisition by Kraemer and the subsequent sale to Durand-Ruel is found in Desparmet Fitz-Gerald 1928-1950, 2:168.  Desparmet Fitz-Gerald refers only to ""Collection Kraemer""; ""Kraemer"", however, possibly could be Eugène Kraemer, a French collector whose estate, which held a Goya portrait, was sold at the Galerie Georges Petit in 1913 (_Catalogue des tableaux anciens, écoles anglaise et française du XVIIIe siécle_, Galerie Georges Petit, Paris, 28-29 April 1913).

[1] The name ""Ginevra"" was too common in the Renaissance to assume with Jean Adhémar (""Une galerie de portraits italiens à Amboise en 1500,"" _Gazette des Beaux Arts_ 86, no. 1281 (October 1975): 100), followed by Fern Rusk Shapley (_Catalogue of the Italian Paintings_, 2 vols., Washington, D.C., 1979: 1:251-255), that a portrait of a lady so named in an inventory made at Amboise in 1500 refers to Leonardo's painting, which the early sources, to the contrary, place in Florence. It is not known whether the painting belonged to the Benci family in the early sixteenth century, as Antonio Billi (_Il Libro di Antonio Billi esistente in due copie nella Biblioteca nazionale di Firenze_, ed. Carl Frey, Berlin, 1892: 51), who presumably saw it, does not give its location. 

     The picture may well have entered the Liechtenstein Collection by 1712 or earlier, as the 1733 red wax seal on the reverse, bearing the Liechtenstein arms, designated works that were part of the ""Fideikommissgalerie"" of Prince Johann Adam, held in trust but not personally collected by the then-reigning Prince Josef Wenzel (1696-1772) (see Reinhold Baumstark, ""Collecting Paintings,"" in _Liechtenstein, The Princely Collections_, exh. cat., The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 1985: 183-185). The founder of the picture gallery at Feldsberg was Prince Karl Eusebius (1611-1684), a distinguished connoisseur who liked small cabinet-type paintings. He was succeeded by his son, the already mentioned Prince Johann Adam, also an avid collector who, however, preferred the Italian Baroque. Either could have obtained the painting in Florence, where both traveled (Olga Raggio, ""The Collection of Sculpture,"" in _Liechtenstein, The Princely Collections_, exh. cat., The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 1985: 63-65). Leonardo's authorship, in any case, came to be forgotten, as the panel was attributed to Lucas Cranach in the Liechtenstein Catalogue of 1780.

[2] During World War II the picture was transferred, with the rest of the collection, from the Garden Palace in Vienna to the castle at Vaduz in the principality of Liechtenstein, and from there it was acquired from Prince Franz Josef II for the National Gallery of Art.

National Archives RG260/Property Division/Box 22, copy in NGA curatorial files).  The collection was likely established by Bruno's father, Heinrich Stahl [1868-1942] of Berlin.  Bruno left Germany for Brussels in 1933 where he remained until 1940. He and his family eventually emigrated to the United States after 1941.  The Pissarro was transferred to the Jeu de Paume and taken by Hermann Goering on 17 March 1941, as _Louvreansicht_, (No. 20 on the _Nachtrag zur Liste v. 20.10.42 der für die Sammlung des Reichsmarschalls Hermann Göring abgegebenen Kunstgegenstände_ dated 9 April 1943 in OSS Consolidated Interrogation Report #2, The Goering Collection, Attachment 5, National Archives RG239/Entry 75/Box 85, copy in NGA curatorial files). Goering traded the picture to Gustave Rochlitz in exchange for a Raffaellino del Garbo and a Wouters (OSS Consolidated Interrogation Report #1, Activities of the Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg, p. 30, National Archives RG239/Entry 75/Box 85, copy in NGA curatorial files).  The painting remained with Rochlitz, in whose possession it was found after the war (Detailed Interrrogation Report #4, Gustave Rochlitz, p. 9, National Archives RG239/Entry 74/Box 84, copy in NGA curatorial files). The painting was restituted to France on 27 March 1946 (Munich property card #8040/6; French Receipt for Cultural Objects no. 5A, item no. 289, copies in NGA curatorial files). It was exhibited in 1946 in _Les Chefs-d'oeuvre des collections privées françaises retrouvés en Allemagne par la Commission de Récuperation artistique et les Services alliés_, no. 33. It was restituted to Wildenstein, from whose vault it had been removed, on 24 October 1947, and returned to Stahl that same year. Stahl sold the picture to Wildenstein on 5 January 1949.

[1] A letter from Level to Picasso dated 24 January 1908 in the Musée Picasso confirms a studio visit at that time (copy in NGA curatorial files; see also email from Annie Cohen Solal dated 4 October 2021). The purchase of the painting is described in  André Level, Souvenirs d'un collectionneur_. Paris, 1959: 23.

[2] The fifth _Elegy_ by the German author Rainer Maria Rilke is dedicated to his friend and the owner of the painting, Hertha Koenig, a poet and promoter of art and artists. In November 1914, Rilke wrote to her that he had seen the painting at Thannhauser. In June 1915, while he was living in Munich and finding it difficult to obtain suitable lodgings, Rilke asked Koenig whether, while she and her family were in the country, he might live for a while in her house, and enjoy the privilege of living beside ""the great Picasso.""  His request was granted, and he lived there from June until October. On June 28, in a letter to Thankmar Freiherr von Münchhausen, Rilke wrote that he was ""sitting here in the apartment of friends...with the finest Picasso (the 'Saltimbanques'), in which there is so much Paris that, for the moment, I forget."" (_Wartime Letters of Rainer Maria Rilke 1914-1921_, translated by M.D. Herter Norton, New York, 1940: 29-30). See also _Rainer Maria Rilke: Duino Elegies. The German Text, with an English Translation, Introduction, and Commentary by J.B. Leishman and Stephen Spender_, New York, 1939: 101-102.

[1] It is unclear whether Rosenberg purchased painting as a dealer or for his private collection.  When purchased directly from the artist, it is assumed here that the painting became part of his private collection.  When involved in a later transaction, as here from Wiborg to Dale, it is assumed that Rosenberg was acting as a dealer.



[2] Miss Wiborg lent painting to the Reinhardt Gallery's 1927 exhibition _Loan Exhibition of Paintings from El Greco and Rembrandt to Cezanne and Matisse_.



[3] Valentine Gallery's receipt to Mr. and Mrs. Dale includes the comment ""on order from abroad"" and also indicates that a commission was paid, but does not name Rosenberg.  Rosenberg is named in other, slightly conflicting, information from the Dale Papers that lists the provenance one time as ""...later Miss Wiborg sold it to the Chester Dale Collection through Paul Rosenberg"" and another as ""Mr. Dale bought the picture from the collection of Miss Mary Hoyt Wiborg through Valentine Dudensing [owner of Valentine Gallery]"".  It seems possible that Miss Wiborg, having originally purchased the painting from Rosenberg, returned it there from whence it was sold to Dale through Valentine.

[1] Speculation that the painting was originally in Gertrude Stein's collection in Paris appears to be incorrect, despite the presence of a label on the back of the painting with the name ""Mlle Toklas"" and an address she shared with Stein on it. See the letter, 27 September 1972, from Margaret Potter, former curator at the Museum of Modern Art, to NGA curator John Bullard; in NGA curatorial files, as well as the 1977 statement of Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler quoted in Anne Carnegie Edgerton, ""Picasso's 'Nude Woman' of 1910,"" _The Burlington Magazine_ (July 1980). 

The appendix of Edgerton's article also discusses a letter from Pierre Loeb dated 22 March 1939 that concerns payment for a ""Nu époque cubiste."" Informed about this letter in 1977 by Mary Callery's niece and executrix, Edgerton speculates that it probably refers to the NGA painting.

[2] The American sculptor Mary Callery lent the painting to a Picasso exhibition in New York in 1939, and all of the published references during her ownership give her name as ""Mrs. Meric Callery."" She was married twice, to Frederic R. Coudert, Jr., from June 1923 to May 1931, and for two years, beginning in May 1934, to the Italian industrialist and collector Carlo Frua de Angeli (she was his second wife). 

[3] The painting is identified as in a private collection in Milan in John Golding, _Cubism: A History and an Analysis_, New York, 1959: 87, pl. 9b, which was likely that of Frua de Angeli. The collector lent the painting to a 1960 exhibition in London. He and Mary Callery were married for two years, 1934 to 1936, and it is possible he acquired the painting directly from her.

[1] The provenance of the painting is given in a letter of 8 January 1973 from Klaus G. Perls, director of Perls Galleries, to Charles Parkhurst (in NGA curatorial files). Theodor Franck was director of the Deutsche Bank in Berlin; his daughter brought the painting to the United States.  Tannenbaum's Mannheim gallery exhibited Chagall in 1924 and again in 1927; it is likely the _Houses at Vitebsk_ was sold on one of these occassions.  On Tannenbaum see _Für die Kunst!

[1] Carolyn Lanchner, _Joan Miró_, exh. cat. The Museum of Modern Art, New York, 1993: 378, no. 39, gives this date, likely because Galerie Pierre lent the painting to an exhibition at the Kunsthaus Zurich that opened then. Galerie Pierre also lent the painting to the 1936 International Surrealist exhibition, but Pierre Loeb closed his gallery in 1939 and did not re-open it until 1945. It is not yet known when the painting left his possession and was acquired by the Swiss private collection.

[2] This painting was confiscated by the ERR with others from the Rosenberg collection in France in 1941 (ERR Inventory card UNB335, National Archives RG 260/Property Division/Box 22). It was selected by Hermann Goering from the Jeu de Paume, one of the six untitled paintings by Matisse from the Rosenberg collection listed as numbers 48-53 on the _Nachtrag zur Liste v. 20.10.42 der für die Sammlung des Reichsmarschalls Hermann Göring abgegebenen Kunstgegenstände_ dated 9 April 1943 (OSS Consolidated Interrogation Report #2, The Goering Collection, Attachment 5, National Archives RG239/Entry73/Box 78) and traded 10 December 1941 to Gustav Rochlitz, in whose possession it remained until the end of the war. It was recovered in one of Rochlitz' residences in Bavaria and transferred to the Munich Central Collecting Point, and restituted to France on 27 March 1946 (OSS Detailed Interrogation Report #4, Gustav Rochlitz, National Archives RG239/Entry 74/Box 84 and Munich property card #8049/15; French Receipt for Cultural Objects no. 5A, item no. 298; copies in NGA curatorial files). It was returned to Paul Rosenberg on 17 May 1946 (See letter from the Ministere des Affiares Etrangeres dated 20 February 2001 in NGA curatorial files).  After its restitution, the painting was exhibited in the 1946 _Les Chefs-d'oeuvre des collections privées françaises retrouvés en Allemagne par la Commission de Récupération artistique et les Services alliés_, no. 53.

[1] The artist's heirs were René De Gas, his last surviving brother, who lived in Paris, and the four (of seven) surviving children of his sister Marguerite, who had died in Argentina in 1895.  (His other deceased sister Thérèse left no descendants.) Marguerite's children were: Jeanne Fevre, unmarried and acting on both her own behalf and as the representative of her sister, Madeleine Marie Pauline Fevre, a Carmelite nun; Henri Jean Auguste Marie Fevre, an industrialist who lived in Marseille; and Gabriel Edgar Eugène Fevre, an agent in Montevideo, Uruguay.

[2] On 13 May 1918 a contract was signed between the artist's heirs and the Hébrard foundry authorizing the reproduction of Degas' sculptures in bronze.  Of the approximately 150 statuettes found in the artist's studio after his death, 74 figures were ultimately cast in bronze.  The contract stipulated that two complete sets were to be cast, one for the heirs and one for the foundry, and authorized a limit of twenty casts of each figure to be offered for sale.  The casting process took at least thirteen years, from 1919 to 1932, and according to the contract, the original figures became the property of the foundry.

A bronze of this subject indeed appears in general installation photographs of the 1949 Paris exhibition (Dossier Kaganovitch, Documentation du Musée d'Orsay, Paris), although Kaganovitch reportedly also owned the ""F"" cast as well, albeit later, in 1952.

[1] According to the archives of the Hébrard foundry, cited in Anne Pingeot, _Degas Sculptures_, Paris, 1991: 153-197.  Joseph S. Czestochowski and Anne Pingeot (_Degas Sculptures. Catalogue Raisonné of the Bronzes_, Memphis, 2002: 231) state that the cast left France in 1967. Since the stock from Alfred Flechtheim's Dusseldorf and Berlin galleries, when he closed them in 1933, was mostly sent to the Mayor Gallery in London or the Galerie Simon in Paris, it appears this cast probably went to the latter. Flechtheim moved to London after he closed his galleries, and died there in 1937.

October-November 1926;[2] Ernest Hemingway's fourth wife, Mary Welsh Hemingway [1908-1986], New York;[3] bequest 1987 to NGA.


[1] Provenance from Carolyn Lanchner, _Joan Miró_, Exh. cat., Museum of Modern Art, New York, 1993: no. 22. Although Evan Shipman's name is included here in the provenance, it is not certain that he ever actually owned the painting. Ernest Hemingway wrote in a 1934 article that Shipman made Galerie Pierre put a price on the painting and agree to sell it to him (Shipman), but that Shipman reconsidered the same day, thought Hemingway should have the painting, and the two rolled dice for it. Hemingway won, and purchased the painting from Galerie Pierre by paying for it in monthly installments. (See _Cahiers d'Art_ 1-4[1934]: 32.) It is probable that Galerie Pierre published the painting as being owned by Shipman in the catalogue of the 1925 exhibition to indicate that it was not for sale. (See notes on the provenance prepared in 2004 by NGA intern Jennifer Sudul, in NGA curatorial files.)

[2] Hadley and Ernest divided their possessions shortly before they were officially divorced in December 1926, and Ernest delivered the painting to Hadley (Carlos Baker, _Ernest Hemingway: A Life Story_, New York, 1969: 177, 593 note). Hadley married Paul Mowrer in 1933 and they moved from Paris to Chicago the following year, taking the painting with them. The Mowrers lent the painting to the exhibition _A Century of Progress_ at the Art Institute of Chicago, and it was returned to them after the closing on 1 November 1934 (e-mail of 30 August 2012 from Ryerson Archives, Art Institute of Chicago, in NGA curatorial files). Around this time, Ernest Hemingway, then resident in Key West, Florida, asked Hadley to lend him the painting for a time, to which she apparently agreed (Jack Hemingway, _Misadventures of a Fly Fisherman: My Life With and Without Papa_, Dallas, 1986: 299). The painting was then lent by Hemingway to a Miró exhibition at the Pierre Matisse Gallery in New York that opened 10 January 1935, and closed the next month on 9 February. Matisse notified Hemingway on 18 February 1935 that the painting was being shipped to him that day (telegram, Pierre Matisse to Ernest Hemingway, Incoming Correspondence Series, folder: Matisse, Pierre, Ernest Hemingway Papers, John F. Kennedy Presidential Library, Boston, Massachusetts; kindly brought to NGA's attention by Alex Fernández de Castro). Hemingway never returned the painting to Hadley; he moved to Havanna, Cuba, in 1939/1940, and the painting remained in his possession, except for loans he made to various exhibitions, until his death in 1961. As Hadley told Alice Sokoloff, ""Everyone Ernest married after me thought it [the Miró painting] belonged to her."" See Gioia Diliberto, _Paris Without End: The True Story of Hemingway's First Wife_, New York, 2011: 272, 317 note. This was true of Hemingway's fourth wife, Mary Welsh.

[3] After Hemingway's death, Hadley and Mary reached an agreement about the painting out of court, through their lawyers, in which Mary paid Hadley in return for Hadley giving up her claims to the painting (memo to the file by NGA attorney, recording a phone conversation with Mary Hemingway's attorney, 21 August 1981, copy in NGA curatorial files).

[1] Apparently Aimé Maeght liked the small maquette the artist made of the work, and agreed to buy the cast numbered 2/2 of the large version Miró wanted to do. This cast was the only one completed in the artist's lifetime. (See letter of 9 October 1991 from Shane Dunworth to Jeremy Strick, in NGA curatorial files). The credit for the loan of the sculpture to exhibitions in 1979, 1981, and 1986-1987 is to Galerie Maeght, Fondation Maeght (Saint-Paul), and Mr. and Mrs. Adrien Maeght (Paris), respectively.

[3] Betts (no first name cited) is the name of the buyer in the published sale price list, though Mellon collection records cite Colnaghi as the buyer. It is possible that Betts served as agent for Colnaghi, as he apparently did on other occasions, though there is nothing about the transaction in the Colnaghi ledgers under either Betts or Mellon. This information about Betts was kindly provided by Timothy Warner-Johnson of Colnaghi's (e-mail of 21 October 2004 to Anne Halpern; see also copy of Mellon collection records, both in NGA curatorial files).

The contract stipulated that two complete sets were to be cast, one for the heirs and one for the foundry, and authorized a limit of twenty casts of each figure to be offered for sale.  The casting process took at least thirteen years, from 1919 to 1932, and according to the contract, the original figures became the property of the foundry.  See Sara Campbell, ""Degas' bronzes: Introduction,"" _Apollo_ (August 1995): 6-10.

[1] Kellerman was reportedly Nelly Hébrard's caregiver who became one of her heirs (oral communication from Anne Pingeot to Suzanne Glover Lindsay, 2007). His ownership is cited in the 1963 Parke-Bernet sale catalogue, and confirmed by the stock card for the sculpture in the Otto and Ilse Gerson Papers (copy, NGA curatorial files, printed from Otto and Ilse Gerson Papers [1933-1980], business records, microfilm roll 4052, Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C). Joseph S. Czestochowski and Anne Pingeot, _Degas Sculptures. Catalogue Raisonné of the Bronzes_, Memphis, 2002: 268, give 1956 as the year Kellerman acquired the bronze.

[2] Though no identifying marks were published in the catalogue, this cast has been associated in all subsequent literature with the bronze shown in Otto Gerson's 1958 exhibition, which, according to the catalogue cover, took place summer-fall 1958. The Gerson stock card for the sculpture (""stock #S23""; see note 1) does not record any mark or cast number either, but does provide the ""bought from"" and ""sold to"" information given here.

[3] Eva Avloniti at Sotheby's kindly provided the name of John A. Beck (e-mail of 8 April 2003 to Anne Halpern, in NGA curatorial files). Beck and his wife, Audrey Jones Beck (1922-2003) formed an important collection of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art that was ultimately donated to the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston.

[1] The sculpture was probably conceived in the fall of 1909 and made originally in clay. Shortly thereafter, under the direction of the dealer Ambroise Vollard, an unnumbered edition of around fifteen to eighteen casts was made. (A numbered edition of ten was cast in 1959 by the Valsuani foundry under the direction of Heinz Berggruen.)



[2] Letters from 1970 and 1971 to Henry Hopkins, then director of the Fort Worth Art Center (now the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth), provide the information that Charles Nilsson purchased the sculpture from Galerie d'Art Latin, whose director was Mr. D'Arquian. Mr. Nilsson's son, Charles Nilsson, Jr., wrote that D'Arquian was a French Count, and that his father probably made the purchase just after World War II. The elder Nilsson owned the sculpture at least by 1959, when he lent it to an exhibition in Stockholm. One of the letters implies that it was Nilsson, Jr., who sold the sculpture in 1968 along with a great part of his father's collection after the elder Nilsson's death.  (Letters of 30 December 1970 from Karin Bergqvist Lindegren, Curator, Moderna Museet, Stockholm; 25 January 1971 from Charles Nilsson, Jr.; and 18 February 1971 from Jan Runnqvist, Svensk-Franska Konstgalleriet, Stockholm, copies in NGA curatorial files)

[1]By 1914 Oskar Moll had the most important collection of Matisse in Germany; this picture however is not included on the list of his collection in Siegfried and Dorothea Salzmann, _Oskar Moll Leben und Werk_, Munich 1975.

[2]Mrs. Hanke according to Chester Dale papers in NGA curatorial records; this information was provided to Dale by Kraushaar in a letter dated 19 February 1927 (see Kraushaar Gallery Records, Archives of American Art, Box 1, Folder 43, Outgoing correspondence).  Maud Dale's 1929 book on the Dale collection, _Before Manet to Modigliani_, gives the name as Hauke.

[3] On 7 January 1927 Kraushaar writes to Reid & Lefevre for information on the ""small Matisse that I bought from you,"" and shortly thereafter conveys information about this picture to Chester Dale. (See Kraushaar Gallery Records, Archives of American Art, Box 1, Folder 72, Outgoing Correspondence). Etienne Bignou was probably involved in the sale to Dale, as a photograph of the picture is included in the Bignou albums at the documentation center of the Musée d'Orsay (copy NGA curatorial files). Bignou often acted on Dale's behalf in conjunction with Reid & Lefèvre.

[1] The April 27 date, from the Archives Henri Matisse in Paris, is given in _Matisse in Morocco: The Paintings and Drawings, 1912-1913_, exh. cat., National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. (plus three subsequent venues), 1990: 72 note 1. The April 30 date, from the Bernheim-Jeune records (where the painting is their number 19329 and titled _Matin de mars près de Tanger_), is given in Guy-Patrice and Michel Dauberville, _Henri Matisse chez Bernheim-Jeune_, 2 vols., Paris, 1995: 1: 508-509, no. 122.


[2] The _Matisse in Morocco_ catalogue (see note 1) cites a letter of 20 April 1951 from Greta Moll to Alfred Barr (in the Alfred H. Barr, Jr. Papers, Archives, The Museum of Modern Art, New York) that says in part: ""... Besides we owned for a long time...the _Palm Leaf_... The _Palm Leaf_ we probably had from 1913 to 1930."" By 1914 Oskar Moll, who with his wife was an original class member of the school Matisse set up in Paris in 1908, had the most important collection of the artist's work in Germany. The Molls were in Berlin when they acquired the NGA painting; they went to Breslau (now Wroclaw, Poland) in 1919, to Düsseldorf in 1930, and returned to Berlin in the mid-1930s. See also Siegfried and Dorothea Salzmann, _Oskar Moll Leben und Werk_, Munich, 1975: 62, and letter of 17 July 1997 from Peter Kropmanns, in NGA curatorial files.


[3] The painting is visible in a photograph of Thannhauser's apartment, taken c. 1932/1933 and sent to the Barrs by Thannhauser. A photocopy of the photograph is in NGA curatorial files, along with the Barr's collection record for the painting.


[4] Valentine Gallery is included in the provenance given in _Henri Matisse 1904-1917_, exh. cat., Centre Georges Pomidou, Paris, 1993: no. 98, but no supporting documentation is given. The Archives of American Art holds some Valentine Gallery records, but they do not include any information about this painting. See note 6.


[5] Erhard Weyhe (1882-1972) came to the United States from Germany in 1914, having apprenticed as a book dealer in his native country, Italy, and Belgium. In his New York gallery, managed for many years after World War I by Carl Zigrosser, Weyhe specialized in art books and prints, and he made annual buying trips to Europe. (See Reba White Williams, ""The Weyhe Gallery Between the Wars, 1919-1940,"" Ph.D. diss., The City University of New York, 1996.) The extant Weyhe Gallery records at the Archives of American Art deal almost exclusively with prints, and no mention of the Matisse painting was found.


[6] Mrs. Alfred H. Barr, Jr., in a letter of 27 June 1981 (in NGA curatorial files), relates that when Justin Thannhauser left Germany for Paris prior to World War II, he did not take the painting. Mrs. Barr suggests that it may have been entrusted to the Molls, or was re-bought by them, as her husband's impression was that ""Weyhe had come upon it or heard about it in Dresden and that it belonged to Greta Moll by that time impoverished;"" she also writes that her husband must have bought the painting ""after 1945.""

[1]This painting was confiscated by the ERR in 1941 with others from the Rosenberg collection in France (see inventory of Rosenberg-Bernstein collection, National Archives RG260/Box 470/file XI, and ERR inventory card UNB322, National Archives RG260/Property Division/Box 22, copies NGA curatorial files). Documents from the National Archives in Washington indicate that the painting was selected by Hermann Goering on 3 March 1941 from the Jeu de Paume (OSS Consolidated Interrogation Report #2, The Goering Collection, 15 September 1945, Attachment 5, 2. Nachtrag zur Liste der für die Sammlung des Reichsmarschalls Hermann Göring abgegebenen Kunstgegenstände, dated 9 April 1943, no. 6, National Archives RG239/Entry 73/Box 78, copy NGA curatorial files).  Goering is documented as having traded the painting to Gustav Rochlitz, who claimed to have sold it to Hans Wendland (OSS Consolidated Interrogation Report #1, Activity of the Einsatzstab Rosenberg in France, 15 August 1945, V: Details of Exchanges, exchange #1, item no. 7, National Archives RG 239/Entry 74/Boxes 84-84A and  OSS Detailed Interrogation Report #4, Gustav Rochlitz, 15 August 1945, Einsatzstab Confiscated Paintings Sold by Rochlitz, no. 30, National Archives RG239/Entry74/Boxes 85-85A, copies NGA curatorial files.). However, according to Wendland, the Matisse remained with Rochlitz (OSS Detailed Interrogation Report, Hans Wendland, 18 September 1946, pp. 14-16, National Archives RG 239/Entry 73/Box 82, copy NGA curatorial files).  Further documentation at the National Archives supports Wendland's claim. The picture is not among those known to have been sent by him to Switzerland with others from the same sale from Rochlitz (see Douglas Cooper, Report of Mission to Switzerland, 10 December 1945, pp. 8-9, National Archives RG 239/Entry 73/Box 82, copy NGA curatorial files).  Moreover, in a letter dated 18 January 1945, Paul Rosenberg's brother Edmond states that by that time the picture was in a private collection in Paris, having been sold by the dealers Kohl and Renoux of rue Faubourg St. Honoré, Paris (Rosenberg claim file, National Archives RG260/OMGUS/Records of the Museum, Fine Arts and Archives Section/Cultural Property Claims Applications/ Box 743, copies in NGA curatorial files).  Hector Feliciano, in _The Lost Museum_, New York, 1997, p. 121, reports that Matisse himself had seen the picture for sale in Paris in 1942. The picture was returned to the Rosenbergs (per telephone conversation with Rosenberg archives 16 March 2001) who later sold it to von Hirsch.

[1] This painting was confiscated by the ERR in 1941 with others from the Rosenberg collection in France (ERR inventory card PR34, National Archives RG260/Property Division/Box 19, copy NGA curatorial files). There is confusion in the archival records as to whether the picture was taken from the Rosenberg vault at Libourne or the chateau at Floirac. In the Rosenberg claim file (National Archives RG260/Box 742, copies NGA curatorial files) there are lists and correspondence from Edmond Rosenberg, brother of Paul Rosenberg, which provide conflicting information. However, it seems likely the picture was taken from Floirac, as it was this part of the Rosenberg collection assigned the code ""PR."" Documents from the National Archives in Washington indicate that the painting was traded by the ERR on 16 November 1943, along with a Bonnard painting from the Kann collection, to the dealer Max Stöcklin in exchange for a painting by Rudolf Alt. (Receipt for the exchange, National Archives RG260/Munich Central Collecting Point/Restitution Research Records/Box 452, copy NGA curatorial files). The picture seems to be confused throughout the archival documentation with another Matisse painting described as of a woman in a yellow chair, which also appears to have been confiscated from the Rosenberg collection. However, this second picture dates from 1939, is in a vertical format, and the woman is nude. On some documents the code PR34 seems to be associated with the 1939 picture, but it is clearly the NGA painting that is described on the ERR card for PR34, and on the receipt for the exchange between Stöcklin and the ERR. Moreoever, the photographs taken by the ERR of confiscated objects illustrate the NGA picture with the code PR34. After Stöcklin, the painting was traced to the Swiss dealer André Martin, and seen on view at the Galerie Neupert in Zurich (See item no. 62 on atachment B to Douglas Cooper's ""Report on Mission to Switzerland,"" 10 December 1945, National Archives RG239/Entry 73/Box 82, copy NGA curatorial files).



The NGA picture was returned to the Rosenbergs by 1948, according to the records of the gallery, which sold it to Somerset Maugham in 1950.

[1] These owners are first mentioned in the catalogue of the Pourtalès-Gorgier sale: _Catalogue des Tableaux Anciens et Modernes Dessins qui composent les Collections de M. le Comte de Pourtalès-Gorgier_, Paris, 1865: 43-44, no. 118. According to Vittorio Malamani, _Memorie del Conte Leopoldo Cicognara_, 2 vols., Venice, 1888: 2:113-114, the painting was found by Cicognara in the attic of an old house in Ferrara.

[2] Vittorio Malamani, _Memorie del Conte Leopoldo Cicognara_, 2 vols., Venice, 1888: 2: 113-114, 125-133. Stewart’s brief ownership is also recorded in a seal bearing his coat of arms now affixed to the stretcher of the relined canvas. Ross Watson identified the seal in 1971; see his notes in NGA curatorial files.

[3] The Paris branch of Duveen Brothers wrote to the New York branch on 29 December 1920, describing the visits of Henry Goldman (they spell the name Goldmann) to see ""the Titian"" and, after Goldman asked them where the picture ""had turned up,"" their telling him ""that Lazzaroni, who was an amateur and had been studying Titian for some years, having spent some years tracing it from the time it left the Pourtalès Collection, had found the picture in England"" (Duveen Brothers Records, accession number 960015, Research Library, Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles: Series II.I, Collector's files, reel 312, box 457, folder 1 [Goldman #1, 1911-1925], copy in NGA curatorial files).

[4] Duveen records document their possession of the painting: it is entered under Lazzaroni's name on 26 March 1920 in their Paris ledger, and the earliest date listed in the ""X Book"" entry for the painting is 30 September 1920, where it is described as ""Painting by Titian, 'Lady at Toilet', ex Baron Lazzaroni"" (Duveen Brothers Records, accession number 960015, Research Library, Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles: Series I.C.

[5] The invoice for the painting is dated 3 February 1922, and Goldman responded the same day, outlining his plan to pay the price in three installments no later than 10 October 1924 (Duveen Brothers Records, accession number 960015, Research Library, Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles: Series II.I, Collector's files, reel 312, box 457, folder 1 [Goldman #1, 1911-1925], copy in NGA curatorial files). The painting was published later the same year: Wilhelm R. Valentiner, “Ein unbekanntes Meisterwerk Tizians,” _Belvedere_ 1 (1922): 91; Wilhelm R. Valentiner, _The Henry Goldman Collection_, New York, 1922: no. 6.

[1] As first pointed out by Christel Haffner in an unpublished dissertation of 1983, the picture is almost certainly identical with one listed as item 66 in the posthumous inventory (1650) of Particelli, Superintendent of Finance under Louis XIV of France: “Item une autre tableau du Tissien representant une dame venitienne plus qu’à demy corps tenant une grenade” (Another picture by Titian, representing a Venetian woman holding a pomegranate, longer than half-length). When it was inherited soon afterwards by La Vrillière, it was described as “portrait d’une femme tenant une pomme en ses mains ayant une guirlande de fleurs su sa tête” (portrait of a woman holding an apple in her hands, and with a garland of flowers on her head). See Mickaël Szanto, “Venise, Reni et la romanité.

[2] The painting was lent by G. Wilbraham to an exhibition at the British Institution in 1829.

[3] The painting was lent by G.F. Wilbraham to an exhibition at the Royal Academy in 1883.

[4] The painting was lent by H.E. Wilbraham to an exhibition at the Burlington Fine Arts Club in 1914.

[5] The painting was seen at Wilbraham's by Duveen agents in 1927, per the Duveen ""Scout book,"" but at that time Wilbraham indicated he was not interested in selling his pictures. He had changed his mind by October 1928, and received the court order necessary to make the sale on 14 January 1929 (Duveen Brothers Records, accession number 960015, Research Library, Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles: Series I.D, General business records, reel 71, box 201: Scouts' books, folder 1: England, ""Things seen""; Series II.A, Files regarding works of art, reel 150, box 295: Titian, folder 18: Titian, ""Portrait of a Lady,"" ex H.E.

[1] Francisco de Borja de San Román y Fernández, ""De la vida del Greco,"" _Archivo Español de Arte y Arqueologia_ 3 (1927): 82, no. 145: ""un San Jerónimo desnudo"" (""a nude Saint Jerome"").  According to this inventory, the painting measured 2 x 1-1/4 _varas_ (approximately 168 x 106 cm).  The present painting is not mentioned by name in the inventory made of the artist's estate in 1614; however, since it was in the possession of El Greco's son in 1621, it seems likely that this painting was one of the ""quinze quadros bosquejados"" (""fifteen paintings sketched in"") mentioned in the inventory of 1614.  Francisco de Borja de San Román y Fernández, _El Greco of Toledo_ (Madrid, 1910): 195.
 
[2] The inventory made of the paintings in the convent included a Saint Jerome by El Greco.  See El Conde de Polentinos, ""El Convento de San Hermengildo, de Madrid,"" _Boletín de la Sociedad Esoabika de Excursiones_ 41 (1933): 50.  According to this inventory, the painting measured ""2 varas y media de alto y ancho"" (""2-1/2 varas in height and width"").  This indicates that the painting was square.  However, because the inventory was inaccurate and inconsistent in many places, it is possible that the compilers of the inventory omitted the width and that they intended to refer to the NGA painting, which was 215 cm tall before the added pieces were removed (Peter Murray, letter, 4 May 1964; and Philip Troutman, letter, 28 May 1964; both in the NGA curatorial files).  The unfinished state of the painting may account for the relatively low valuation of 600 _reales_ assigned it in the 1786 inventory.  For comparison, El Greco's finished portrait of Fray Hortensio Félix Paravicino (now in the MFA, Boston) was valued at 6000 _reales_ in the same inventory.

[1] Stadtarchiv, Nuremberg, Familienarchiv von Praun, E28, No. 1477, unpublished manuscript, _Inventar des Paulus von Praunschen Kunstkabinetts im Stiftungshaus am alten Weinmarkt_... (1719) 9: ""N.119 Von Albr. Dürer Johann Dors gewesen Pfarrers beij St./Johañis contrefait auf Pergament von öel/farb gemahlt, mit ein Schüber, Das Gemäl/ist 18 [sic] S.[chuh] 4 Z[oll] hoch und i.8 S.[chuh] 1. Z[oll] breit."" (Letter of 9 April 1977 to John Hand from Dr. Max Nüchterlein, Nuremberg, as well as a photocopy of the inventory entry and a transcription are in NGA curatorial files.) A _Schuh_ is a unit of measurement equal to approximately one foot, while a _Zoll_ equals approximately one inch.  See John Henry Alexander, _Universal Dictionary of Weights and Measures, Ancient and Modern; Reduced to the Standards of the United States of America_ (Baltimore, 1850) 103-104, 124-125.  In the cemetery of the Saint Johannis church in Nuremberg, John Hand found a label accompanying an iron ""Grabsteinmass,"" used for measuring graves, which indicated that a ""Nurnberger Werkschuh"" equaled 27.84 cm. The dimensions given in Christopher Theophile de Murr, _Description du cabinet de Monsieur Paul de Praun à Nuremberg_. (Nuremberg, 1797) 14, are: ""Haut. 1 Pied, 4 Pouces; Larg. 1 Pied, 1 Pouce."" Joseph Heller, _Das Leben und die Werke Albrecht Dürer's_, 3 vols., Bamberg, 1827: 2:231, gives the German equivelent as: ""1 Sch[uh] 4 Z[oll] hoch, 1 Sch[uh] 1 Z[oll] breit.""

[2] Heller 1827, 260, cites the painting as being in the Czernin collection in 1821, but seems unaware that this is the same painting that he noted earlier in the Praun collection.  His description, however, is clearly that of the Gallery's picture, ""Brustbild eines Mannes, welcher nach Rechts gewendet ist, mit dem Zeichen und der Jahrszahl AD 1516.  Grüner hintergrund auf Leinwand; ohnegefähr 15Z. hoch, 10Z. breit.""  The mention of _Leinwand_ suggests but does not confirm that the backing with fabric took place before 1827. 

[3] Letter of Frederick Mont to the Samuel H. Kress Foundation, 6 February 1950, in NGA curatorial files.  Nancy Marshall of Newhouse Galleries, in a letter to John Hand of 3 May 1988, in NGA curatorial files, noted that from the extant records it was unclear whether the painting was owned jointly or given on consignment.  Marshall did confirm that the number 57737 on a paper sticker on the reverse was a Newhouse Galleries number, as indicated by Colin Eisler, _Paintings from the Samuel H. Kress Collection: European Schools Excluding Italian_, Oxford, 1977: 16.  The bill of sale to the Kress Foundation for the painting, dated 3 May 1950, is on Newhouse Galleries letterhead (copy in NGA curatorial files).

Kress Foundation, New York;[6] gift 1952 to NGA.


[1] In his final testament, drawn up in 1544, Bembo left his entire art collection to Torquato, and instructed him to integrate the objects then in Rome with the bulk of the collection in Padua. For about the next twenty years it remained complete; but thereafter Torquato began to dismantle it, sending important parts of it back to Rome for sale in 1581 and 1583. See Sabine Eiche, “On the Dispersal of Cardinal Bembo’s Collections,” _Mitteilungen des Kunsthistorischen Instituts in Florenz_ 27 (1983): 353–359. Perhaps Titian’s portrait was sold from the Bembo collection around this time.

[2] As pointed out by Jeremy Wood, “Van Dyck’s Cabinet de Titien: The Contents and Dispersal of His Collection,” _The Burlington Magazine_ 132 (1990): 681 n. 9, the picture is very likely to be identical with the portrait of Bembo by Titian acquired by the Sicilian nobleman Don Fabrizio Valguarnera from the dealer Ferrante Carlo before 1631. The portrait is mentioned twice in the documents relating to Valguarnera’s trial for theft in that year: first in an inventory of his possessions (“Il Ritratto di Monse Bembo è di mano di Titiano è quell’istesso che hò detto di sopra d’haver compro da Ferrante de Carolis”); and second in Carlo’s testimony to the court (“Un’ritratto dicono del Bembo di mano di Titiano grande dal mezzo in su’ del naturale”). See Jane Costello, “The Twelve Pictures ‘Ordered by Velasquez’ and the Trial of Valguarnera,” _Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes_ 13 (1950): 273, 276.

[3] According to an inventory of Cardinal Barberini, the picture was acquired on 20 November 1636 from Leone Galli. See Marilyn Aronberg Lavin, _Seventeenth Century Barberini Documents and Inventories of Art_, New York, 1975: 41 no. 334: “Uno in tela con cornice di noce alto pmi cinque in circa un retratto di un Cardinale mano Chredosi della prima maniera de Titiano.” Despite the vagueness of the description, which fails to identify the sitter, the portrait is clearly identical with the one of Bembo listed in subsequent Barberini inventories. These include Cardinal Antonio’s inventories of 1644 (Lavin 1975, 166 no. 232) and 1671 (Lavin 1975, 295 no. 71), and the inventory of his bequests of 1672 (Lavin 1975, 345 no. 230), according to which it was inherited by his nephew. The portrait duly appears in the posthumous 1686 inventory of Maffeo’s legacy to his son (Lavin 1975, 409 no. 342). The evidence of the seventeenth-century Barberini inventories published by Lavin disproves the attempted identification by Wethey of the picture with a portrait of a cardinal by Titian that had been acquired for the family by Bernini before 1631; see Harold Wethey, _The Paintings of Titian_, 3 vols., London, 1969-1975: 2(1971):83.

[4] According to the Getty Provenance Index, the painting is recorded in a 1730 inventory of Cardinal Francesco II Barberini (p. 35, no. 218): ""3695 Un Ritratto del Cardle. Bembo a sedere alto pmi 5, largo pmi 4 incirca, con barba longa, e libro nella mano manca, con cornice liscia dorata, si dice mano del Titiano [attribution crossed out] in cattivo stato 50."" The painting is still recorded in the Barberini collection by Oskar Fischel, _Tizian: Des Meisters Gemälde_, Stuttgart [u.a.], 1904: no. 72, and by George Lafenestre and Eugène Richtenberger, _La Peinture en Europe. Rome: Les musées, les collections particulières, les palais_, Paris, 1905: 157.  

[5] Details of ownership by Volpi, Colnaghi, and Knoedler, and the Schwab purchase date, are according to the Getty Provenance Index and the M. Knoedler & Co. archives, the latter courtesy in 2002 of Edye Weissler, Knoedler archivist and librarian (see the e-mail of 12 September 2002, in NGA curatorial files). The painting is in Colnaghi's private ledgers, and was Knoedler's London number 3828 and New York number 10755. The Knoedler archives citation reads ""4/30/06, stock no. 10755, Titian Cardinal Bembo."" See also M. Knoedler & Co. Records, accession number 2012.M.54, Research Library, Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles: Sales Book 8, 1900 November-1907 April, page 332, copy in NGA curatorial files.

[1] The picture was first certainly recorded in the Hamilton Palace sale of 1882, but the most important part of this collection was inherited by the 10th Duke of Hamilton from his father-in-law, William Beckford. An inventory of Beckford’s collection at Lansdown Crescent, Bath, of 1844 includes in the Great Drawing Room an item described as a “Portrait of a Spanish Admiral in armour holding a Baton, Tintoretto” (Bodleian Library, Oxford, Beckford Papers, c.58, 13 September 1844; information kindly provided by Jeannie Chapel). Since the Gallery’s picture was attributed to Tintoretto in the sale of 1882, it is likely that it corresponds to the Beckford picture: see Fern Rusk Shapley, _Paintings from the Samuel H. Kress Collection: Italian Schools, XV–XVI Century_, London, 1968: 181-182; Fern Rusk Shapley, _Catalogue of the Italian Paintings_, 2 vols., Washington, 1979: 1:485–488, and the correspondence between Fern Rusk Shapley and R.E. Hutchison, Keeper, Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh, March-April 1967, in NGA curatorial files. When in Venice on his Grand Tour in 1780, Beckford particularly admired the work of Tintoretto, and it is possible that he acquired the picture then. See Jeannie Chapel, “William Beckford: Collector of Old Master Paintings, Drawings, and Prints,” in _William Beckford, 1760-1844: An Eye for the Magnificent_, ed. Derek E. Ostergard, exh. cat. Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design and Culture, New York; New Haven and London, 2001: 234.

          As a possible alternative early provenance, it is worth noting that the inventory of the collection of Bartolomeo della Nave, Venice, acquired by the Marquess of Hamilton in 1638, includes an item described as “A Picture of General Capello Pal 2 & 1 Titian.” Hamilton (later 1st Duke) was an ancestor of the 10th Duke; and although the bulk of the ex-Della Nave collection was sold to the archduke Leopold Wilhelm after Hamilton’s execution in 1649, it is possible that this particular picture remained in the family until the 19th century. (This possibility is not disproved by a marginal note on the inventory, implying that the ex-Della Nave portrait of Cappello passed from the Hamilton collection to that of the Duke of Devonshire, since as pointed out by Ellis Waterhouse, “Paintings from Venice for Seventeenth-Century England,” _Italian Studies_ 7 ([1952]): 7, these marginal notes are highly unreliable.) On the other hand, there is no trace of anything corresponding to the Gallery’s picture in the various Hamilton inventories of the 17th and 18th centuries; see Waterhouse 1952, 7, and the Shapley-Hutchison correspondence cited above. Furthermore, the dimensions given in the Della Nave inventory (2 x 1 palms = c. 44 x 22 cm) do not correspond; and although the measurements given in the inventory are often very inaccurate, the reference here appears to be to a much smaller picture.

          Shapley 1979, 1:485-488, also hypothetically identified the Gallery’s picture with one recorded by Ridolfi, a work by Titian then in  the collection of Senator Domenico Ruzzino in Venice: “Il ritratto di Vicenzo Cappello General di Mare, in arme brunite tocche con belle osservationi di lumi, nelle quale reflette il manto purpureo, che gli attraversa alle spalle, afflibato co’ globbi d’oro, celebratissimo per il soggetto e per l’Autore;” Carlo Ridolfi, _Le maraviglie dell’arte, overo Le vite de gl'illustri pittori veneti, e dello stato_ (Venice, 1648), ed. Detlev von Hadeln, 2 vols., Berlin, 1914-1924: 1(1914):200. But the reference to the fixing of the cloak with “globbi d’oro” does not correspond to the present picture, and suggests rather the arrangement seen in Palma Giovane’s later portraits of Niccolò Cappello (Stefania Mason Rinaldi, _Palma il Giovane: L’opera completa_, Milan, 1984: 80, no. 57; 101, no. 207).

[1] On a label on the reverse of the painting is written ""Bought for His Majesty in Italy, 1626."" It is not known from whom in Italy the picture was bought. As pointed out by Erica Tietze-Conrat, “Titian’s Workshop in His Late Years,” _The Art Bulletin_ 28 (1946): 81, it is certainly identifiable with the item in Abraham Van der Doort’s 1639 inventory of Charles I’s collection, placed in the Privy Lodging Room of Whitehall Palace, and described as follows: “Item Above the doore. Duke grettie of Venus wth his right hand houlding his roabes: Bought by the Kinge halfe figures So bigg as the life. In a black wodden guilded frame. Done by Tichian” (Oliver Millar, “Abraham van der Doort’s Catalogue of the Collection of Charles I,” _Walpole Society_ 37 [1960 ]: 21). (The handwriting on the label, while apparently of the 17th century, is not that of Van der Doort, cataloger of the royal collection.) The dimensions, given as 4 feet 4 inches high by 3 feet 4 inches wide, also correspond closely. See also Francis Haskell, “Charles I’s Collection of Pictures,” in _The Late King’s Goods. Collections, Possessions and Patronage of Charles I in the Light of the Commonwealth Sale Inventories_, ed. Arthur MacGregor, London and Oxford, 1989: 204. The royal stamp of a CR surmounted by a crown was once visible on the back of the canvas (as reported by Karl Wilczek, _Katalog der Graf Czernin’schen Gemäldegalerie in Wien_, Vienna, 1936: 88-89), but the 1955 transfer of the canvas to a new stretcher has concealed it.

[1]  This seems probable because the painting appears to have been owned by the artist's son in 1621 (see note 2). Because the inventory of El Greco's estate in 1614 does not include measurements, it is difficult to identify the National Gallery painting with a specific reference in this document. However, if the painting was given the same title in 1614 as in 1621, it can probably be identified as ""Una imagen, con el niño dormido y S. Joseph y Santa ana y S. Jn bautista"" (""An image with the sleeping child and Saint Joseph and Saint Anne and Saint John the Baptist""); Francisco de Borja de San Román y Fernández, _El Greco en Toledo_, Madrid, 1910: 192. However, as Harold E. Wethey, _El Greco and His School_, Princeton, 1962: 2:59, suggests, the National Gallery painting might have been described as ""Una imagen con el Niño y s. Joseph y S. Ana no acabada (""An unfinished painting with the Child and Saint Joseph and Saint Anne""). See Francisco de Borja de San Román y Fernández, _El Greco en Toledo_, Madrid, 1910: 193.

[2]  No. 16 in the inventory made of his possessions in 1621 reads:  ""Una ymagen con su niño dormido santa ana y san Joseph y San Ju bautista, y quadro dorado, tiene de ancho casi media bara y de alto dos terzias"" (""An image [of the Virgin] with the Child sleeping, Saint Anne and Saint Joseph and Saint John the Baptist, and a gilded frame, measures in width almost half a _vara_ and in height almost two-thirds""). Francisco de Borja de San Román y Fernández, ""De la vida del Greco,"" _Archivo Español de Arte y Arqueologia_ 3 (1927): 288. Because a _vara_ (a traditional Spanish measurement) equals approximately 84 cm, no. 16 of the inventory would have been 42 cm in width and 56 cm in height. These figures are close to the measurements of the NGA painting. El Greco's other interpretations of the subject are significately larger. Compare Wethey 1962, 2:58, 59, nos. 85, 87. The copies of El Greco's other paintings of the subject are significately larger than the NGA painting. Compare Wethey 1962, 2:189-190, nos. X-105 through X-109.

This individual and the European collector resident in New York (see note 8), was very likely Michael Dreicer's widow, Maisie Shainwald Dreicer, who, after her first husband's death, traveled frequently between New York and Europe. Born Maisie Seville Shainwald, she married twice more, first, in 1923, to the British engineer and naval architect, Jardine Bell Whyte (1880-1954), and second, after their divorce, in February 1935 to Baron René de Kerchove d'Exaerde (1883-1971), author of _International Maritime Dictionary_, first published in 1948. After her third marriage she was known as the Baroness de Kerchove. Dr. Tara Mitchell Mielnik, of the Metropolitan Historical Commission in Nashville, kindly shared her research about the Baroness; see her e-mails of 8 July 2010 and 24 September 2010, in NGA curatorial files.

[8] Robert Carlucci of the Paul Drey Gallery, letter of 4 August 1988, NGA curatorial files, wrote that the painting was owned during the early 1940's by a European collector resident in New York, who still owned it in 1947, and who consigned it to the Paul Drey Gallery ""for some period of time.""  See note 7.

Liphart is also listed as the owner in _Amtliche Berichte aus den Königlichen Kunst Sammlungen_, 1 July 1891: IV, no. 3, and he is cited as the lender of the sculpture in the catalogue of a 1935 exhibition at the Drey galleries in New York.

Charles de Tolnay's 1943 book, _The Youth of Michelangelo_ (vol. 1 of 5, Princeton, pp. 233-234), lists the sculpture as with a New York dealer at that time, but a note in Drey's prospectus specifically refutes this fact, indicating the sculpture belonged to von Liphart.",Samuel H.

[1] As noted in an inventory kept by Gauguin noting the whereabouts of his paintings. A facsimile of the carnet containing the inventory list is reproduced and annotated in René Huyghe, _Le Carnet de Paul Gauguin_ (Paris, 1950), volume II, page 226. Mme Kohler was a neighbor of Emile Schuffennecker, Amédée's brother.  (See Marice Maligne, ed.,_Letters of Gauguin_, Paris, 1946, p.132, n.2.) Claude Emile Schuffenecker was a friend and early collector of Gauguin. Due to his divorce that was finalized in 1904, he sold his collection of over 100 works by Gauguin, van Gogh and others to his brother Amédée in the hopes that the collection would remain in tact. Amédée, however, was just starting out as a dealer and sold many of the works. (See Sophie Monneret, _Impressionnisme et son époque_, Paris, 1978, volume 2, p. 333 and _Claude-Emile Schuffenecker_, Exh. cat., University Art Gallery, State University of New York at Binghamton and Hammer Galleries, 1980, p. 29).  This picture might have been among those that passed between the brothers. The painting was for sale when exhibited in Frankfurt in 1906.

 [2] According to Daniel Wildenstein, _Gauguin: Premier itinéraire d'un sauvage_, 2001: no. 258, the painting had left the sitter's possession c. 1904. It is for sale when exhibited in Munich in 1906.

After Margarethe lent the painting to an exhibition at the Statens Museum for Kunst in Copenhagen in 1936, the director of that museum offered to store it for her during World War II.  After the war, Margarethe asked the director to arrange for it to be sold. See also Thomas W.

[1] Claude Emile Schuffenecker was a friend and early collector of Gauguin. Due to his divorce that was finalized in 1904, he sold his collection of over 100 works by Gauguin, van Gogh, and others to his brother Amédée in the hopes that the collection would remain in tact. Amédée, however, was just starting out as a dealer and sold many of the works. (See Sophie Monneret, _Impressionnisme et son époque_, Paris, 1978: 2:333 and _Claude-Emile Schuffenecker_, Exh. cat., University Art Gallery, State University of New York at Binghamton and Hammer Galleries, 1980: 29). This picture is likely among those that passed between the brothers. In 1908 it was exhibited at the Kunstsalon W. Zimmermann in Munich, probably for sale; Amédée often sold through the German art market.

[1] Christopher Gray, _Sculpture and Ceramics of Paul Gauguin_, Baltimore, 1963: 200, claims Malingue had a photograph dating from 1889 that showed these with the _Figure of a Martinique Negress_, which is documented as belonging to Marie Henry.  Maurice Malingue, ""Du nouveau sur Gauguin"", _L'Oeil_ 55-56 (July-August 1959): 37-38, himself lists among some old photographs of works belonging to her, a photograph of sabots taken in 1895, whose description matches only the National Gallery pair in size, polychromy, and decoration with human figures: ""No. 7: Sabots de Gauguin sculptés et peints, 13 x 33 cm. Sur le dessus des sabots, dans un cercle, sont sculptées de petites Bretonnes.""

[1] The standard provenance that identifies Piétri of Papeete as the buyer from the 1903 death sale is based on Jean Loize, _Les Amitiés du peintre Georges-Daniel de Monfreid et ses reliques de Gauguin_, Paris, 1951, 133: ""Au dos [of Georges-Daniel Monfreid's notes about Gauguin's death], liste d'oeuvres de Gauguin achetées avant ou après sa mort...Les bois...'Thérèse et l'Evêque' aux mains de M. Piétri, Juge à Tahiti probablement....""  This is Monfreid's purely speculative statement, based on information that Loize believes comes from Victor Segalen.  The judge is a documented buyer of an inexpensive ""tiki"" (no. 64 at six francs; in Georges Wildenstein, ed., ""Vente des oeuvres d'art, livres et objets ayant appartenu à Gauguin. 2 septembre 1903"", _Gazette des Beaux Arts_, 6th per., 47, January-April 1956; published January 1958, 207).  However various other references suggest that the pendants went to Lévy, who bought three ""tikis"" from the sale (nos. 60-62 at 16, 15, and 20 francs (Wildenstein 1956, 207).  Segalen himself (_Lettres de Paul Gauguin à Georges-Daniel de Monfreid, précédées d'un hommage par Victor Segalen_, Paris and Zurich, 1918, 67-68) identified the pendants' buyer at the sale as a merchant (Lévy was a pearl merchant) and Henri Jacquier (""Histoire locale: Le dossier de la succession Paul Gauguin,"" _Bulletin de la Société des Etudes Océaniennes_, 120 [September 1957], 677) states that Lévy sold the pendants two years later to Edouard Druet.  Victor Merlhès (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Paris, correspondence with Anne Halpern dated 14 December 1999, in NGA curatorial files) suggested this alternative provenance and the texts that support it.  The Druet ownership is also based on a fragment of a paper label on the underside of the figure, on which is written, in ink, in block letters: [GALER] IE [D]RUET; in lower case: St-Honoré Par[is]/[Gaugui]n/[Paill]ard; and a printed number: 9 6 [996?].  The number could possibly be an inventory number.



[2] The provenance that places the work in the collections of Emile Schuffenecker and Ambroise Vollard is found in Christopher Gray, _Sculpture and Ceramics of Paul Gauguin _, Baltimore, 1963: 288.  A photograph in the Eitenne Bignou albums at the documentation center of the Musée d'Orsay is annotated with Vollard and Schuffenecker as former owners (copy NGA curatorial files). The Chester Dale papers (in NGA curatorial files) document only Vollard's ownership, and the provenance is recorded twice: ""Mr.  Bignou got it from Am. Vollard, who had it from Gauguin;"" and ""Former collection Ambrose[sic] Vollard, Paris, who bought it from Gauguin.""   Merlhès (as above, note 1) discounted their plausibility altogether.

However, according to an undated memo by former NGA curator David Rust (copy in NGA curatorial files), the sculpture reproduced in the 1927 sale catalogue is not this work.

(On 1 May 1513 was brought from India to the great and powerful king Emanuel of Portugal to Lisbon such a live animal called a rhinoceros. It is represented here in its complete form. It has the color of a speckled tortoise and it is covered and well covered with thick plates. It is like an elephant in size, but lower on its legs and almost invulnerable. It has a strong sharp horn on the front of its nose which it always begins sharpening when it is near rocks. The obstinate animal is the elephant’s deadly enemy. The elephant is very frightened of it as, when it encounters it, it runs with its head down between its front legs and gores the stomach of the elephant and throttles it, and the elephant cannot fend it off. Because the animal is so well armed, there is nothing that the elephant can do to it. It is also said that the rhinoceros is fast, lively, and cunning.

[1] John Rewald, ""Theo Van Gogh, Goupil, and the Impressionists"", _Gazette des Beaux Arts_, 6th per., 81 (January-February 1973): 72. Claire Frèches-Thory in _The Art of Paul Gauguin_, Exh. cat., National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; Art Institute of Chicago; Galeries Nationales du Grand Palais, Paris; Washington, D.C., 1988: 183, claims Schuffenecker owned _Eve_, presumably on the basis of the 1891 Brussels exhibition catalogue in which his is the only lenders' name cited for Gauguin's entries there.  However, his name appears below the last three entries, ""4. trois vases (poterie),"" as if these alone were his.  That conclusion is supported by a letter from Schuffenecker to Octave Maus, the organizer of the _Vingtiste_ exhibition, cited in Rewald 1973: 68, n. 140, that reportedly claims he merely lent three ceramic pieces to the show--hence the three ""pottery"" vases.



[2] This possibility was suggested by Victor Merlhès (personal communication) based on Gauguin's letter of early 1894, to be published in a forthcoming volume of the correspondence, that refers to _La Femme Noire_ in Gauguin's exhibition of 1893 at Durand-Ruel as belonging to Manzi.  Merlhès' proposal challenges the current identification of this work as _Black Venus_ (Nassau County Museum of Art, Roslyn Harbor, New York).

[2] On 13 May 1918 a contract was signed between the artist's heirs and the Hébrard foundry authorizing the reproduction of Degas' sculptures in bronze.  Of the approximately 150 statuettes found in the artist's studio after his death, 74 figures were ultimately cast in bronze.  The contract stipulated that two complete sets were to be cast, one for the heirs and one for the foundry, and authorized a limit of twenty casts of each figure to be offered for sale.  The casting process took at least thirteen years, from 1919 to 1932, and according to the contract, the original figures became the property of the foundry.

Although Ferargil's records list Arthur ""Block"" as the buyer, this is almost certainly Arthur Bloch, a partner in N. Snellenberg & Co. (a department store in Philadelphia and Wilmington) and wealthy collector whose interests included material related to Benjamin Franklin (see a Parke-Bernet Galleries sale of 20 October 1954 in New York).

[2] On 13 May 1918 a contract was signed between the artist's heirs and the Hébrard foundry authorizing the reproduction of Degas' sculptures in bronze.  Of the approximately 150 statuettes found in the artist's studio after his death, 74 figures were ultimately cast in bronze.  The contract stipulated that two complete sets were to be cast, one for the heirs and one for the foundry, and authorized a limit of twenty casts of each figure to be offered for sale.  The casting process took at least thirteen years, from 1919 to 1932, and according to the contract, the original figures became the property of the foundry.

Knoedler & Company, Inc., New York); purchased May 1956 by Paul Mellon, Upperville, Virginia; bequest 1999 to NGA.

[1] The artist's heirs were René De Gas, his last surviving brother, who lived in Paris, and the four (of seven) surviving children of his sister Marguerite, who had died in Argentina in 1895.  (His other deceased sister Thérèse left no descendants.) Marguerite's children were: Jeanne Fevre, unmarried and acting on both her own behalf and as the representative of her sister, Madeleine Marie Pauline Fevre, a Carmelite nun; Henri Jean Auguste Marie Fevre, an industrialist who lived in Marseille; and Gabriel Edgar Eugène Fevre, an agent in Montevideo, Uruguay.  See Anne Pingeot and Frank Horvat, _Degas sculptures_, Paris, 1991, and Anne Pingeot, ""The casting of Degas' sculptures: Completing the story,"" _Apollo_ (August 1995): 60-63.



[2] On 13 May 1918 a contract was signed between the artist's heirs and the Hébrard foundry authorizing the reproduction of Degas' sculptures in bronze.  Of the approximately 150 statuettes found in the artist's studio after his death, 74 figures were ultimately cast in bronze.  The contract stipulated that two complete sets were to be cast, one for the heirs and one for the foundry, and authorized a limit of twenty casts of each figure to be offered for sale.  The casting process took at least thirteen years, from 1919 to 1932, and according to the contract, the original figures became the property of the foundry.  See Sara Campbell, ""Degas' bronzes: Introduction,"" _Apollo_ (August 1995): 6-10.



[3] The article by Anne Pingeot referenced in note 1 provides details of the role of Hébrard's daughter in the history of the foundry, and its work in casting the bronzes.

[1] Christopher Gray, _Sculpture and Ceramics of Paul Gauguin_, Baltimore, 1963: 200, claims Malingue had a photograph dating from 1889 that showed these with the _Figure of a Martinique Negress_, which is documented as belonging to Marie Henry.  Maurice Malingue, ""Du nouveau sur Gauguin"", _L'Oeil_ 55-56 (July-August 1959): 37-38, himself lists among some old photographs of works belonging to her, a photograph of sabots taken in 1895, whose description matches only the National Gallery pair in size, polychromy, and decoration with human figures: ""No. 7: Sabots de Gauguin sculptés et peints, 13 x 33 cm. Sur le dessus des sabots, dans un cercle, sont sculptées de petites Bretonnes."" For a biography of Marie Henry (""Poupée""), see Jean-Marie Cusinberche, ""La Buvette de la Plage racontée par...,"" in _Chemin de Gauguin: Génèse et rayonnement_, Exh. cat., Musée Départemental du Prieuré, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, 1985: 114-115, 127. Gauguin stayed at her inn intermittently from the summer of 1889 through November 1890 (Charles Chassé, _Gauguin et le groupe de Pont-Aven. Documents inédits_, Paris, 1921: 25; Charles Chassé, _Gauguin et son temps_, Paris, 1955: 65-67; and Cahn in _The Art of Paul Gauguin_, Exh. cat. National Gallery of Art; Art Institute of Chicago; Galeries Nationales du Grand Palais; Washington, D.C., 1988: 47-49). For an account of Gauguin's lawsuit against Henry, to reclaim works left with her in 1890, see Chassé 1955, 89.

In 1937, Lévy was selling through Seligmann two Renoirs now in the collection of the NGA (1956.4.1-2) so it is possible he sold the Seurat through Seligmann as well. However, to date no documents concerning the Seurat have been discovered in the records of Jacques Seligmann and Co. at the Archives of American Art, Washington, D.C.

Kress Foundation, New York;[7] gift 1952 to NGA.


[1] The emblem of the queen bee surrounded by her subjects, visible on the reverse of the painting, appears also on the reverse of a medal made by Michele Mazzafirri for Grand Duke Ferdinand I de' Medici in 1588; see Karla Langedijk, _The Portraits of the Medici, 15th-18th Centuries_, Florence, 1983: 2:760-761. It is uncertain whether the NGA painting is the one described as ""1o quadro colla testa di Giuliano de' Medici"" (""one picture with the head of Giuliano de' Medici"") in the 1503 inventory of the Cafaggiolo branch of the family collection (see John Shearman, ""The Collections of the Younger Branch of the Medici,"" _Burlington Magazine_ 117 [1975]: 26); in fact, several versions of Giuliano's portrait must have been painted, a number of which still exist today. No portrait of him is mentioned, however, in the 1492 inventory of the Medici Palace in Via Larga (see _Libro d'inventario dei beni di Lorenzo di Magnifico_, ed. by Marco Spallanzani and Giovanni Gaeta Bertelà, Florence, 1992; and Maria Grazia Ciardi Duprè Dal Poggetto, ""I dipinti di Palazzo Medici nell'inventario di Simone de Stagio delle Pozze: Problemi di committenza e di arredo,"" in _Toscana al temp di Lorenzo il Magnifico: Politica, economia, cultura, arte. Convegno di studi promosso dale Università di Firenze, Pisa e Siena, 5-8 novembre 1992_, 3 vols., Pisa, 1996: 160-161) or in the 1560 inventory of the apartments of Cosimo I de' Medici in the Palazzo Vecchio (see James H. Beck, ""The Medici Inventory of 1560,"" _Antichità Viva_ 13 [1974]: no. 3, 64-66, and no. 5, 61-63). A ""quadretto pittovi la testa di Giuliano di Piero de' Medici in carta pecora"" (""a little picture with the head of Giuliano di Piero de' Medici painted on parchment""), certainly not identifiable with the NGA painting, is listed in inventories of 1553 and later (Karla Langedijk, _The Portraits of the Medici. 15th-18th Centuries_, 3 vols., Florence, 1981-1987: (1983):1063).



[2] The presence of a label with the inscription _Etruria pittrice_ (see also note 5) suggests that by 1796 the painting belonged to marquis Alfonso Tacoli-Canacci, in whose catalogue it is registered under no. 444. As Dr. Vincenzo Buonocore informs Miklós Boskovits in a letter of 17 June 2002 (copy in NGA curatorial files), the painting was probably acquired by Tacoli Canacci after 1792, as it does not appear in the list of his paintings compiled in that year (now in the Real Biblioteca in Madrid, ms. II/574).



[3] The Getty Provenance Index states that the painting used to belong to the Coccapani Imperiali family. A handwritten note on the back of a photograph in Bernard Berenson's photographic files at the Biblioteca Berenson, I Tatti, Florence, states that the painting was ""found"" in Modena and that it entered the Cini collection through a Modenese dealer (see following notes). According to Dr. Vincenzo Buonocore, who is preparing a detailed study on the history of the Tacoli-Canacci collection, after the death of marquese Alfonso, his paintings went to his nephew and heir, Pietro Tacoli, and subsequently to the daughter of the latter, Adelaide, wife of Alessandro Bellincini Bagnesi in Modena.



[4] The anonymous author of an article in the magazine _Europeo_ (8 July 1951, translation in NGA curatorial files) states that the painting was acquired ""before the war [World War II] [by] Count Vittorio Cini through Prof. Zelindo Bonaccini of Modena."" Working also as a painter, Bonaccini was known mostly for his activity as a dealer (see Alberto Barbieri, _Arte ed artisti a Modena_, Modena, 1982: 407).



[5] A publication on the paintings and works of art belonging to the Cini collection (Nino Barbantini, _Il Castello di Monselice_, Venice, 1940) does not yet mention the painting. However, Dr.  Buonocore owns a list of paintings sold in 1940 by Adele Bagnesi to Count Cini which includes the _Giuliano de' Medici_ (communication to Miklós Boskovits).



[6] According to a handwritten note on a photograph owned by Bernard Berenson (see note 3), the painting was with Wildenstein's by 1948; it was offered by this firm to Rush H. Kress for acquisition on 30 March 1949 (copy of letter in NGA curatorial files).



[7] The Wildenstein invoice to the Kress Foundation for 16 items, including the Botticelli painting, is dated 23 June 1949 (copy in NGA curatorial files, see also The Kress Collection Digital Archive, https://kress.nga.gov/Detail/objects/971).

Max Jordan, 6 vols. in 8 parts, Leipzig, 1870: 3:178. An annotated copy of the 1865 Pourtalès-Gorgier sale catalogue in the NGA Library indicates the buyer was Triqueti.



[3] According to Bernard Berenson, ""A Botticelli Portrait in the Collection of Mr. Carl W. Hamilton,"" _Art in America_ 10, no. 1 (December 1921): 29, who stated that he had seen the painting there ""twelve or more years"" earlier.



[4] The Baron's daughter, who married Comte Hubert de Pourtalès in 1890, was her father's sole heir. Edward Fowles (_Memories of Duveen Brothers_, London, 1976: 102-103, 134) discusses the original purchase agreement with Wildenstein and Seligmann for some of the works in the Schickler collection, and the subsequent agreement in 1922 that divided the works among the three dealers. Although Fowles indicates the sale took place in April 1919, the list of expenses for the painting in the Duveen Brothers Records show the purchase was made the next year (copy in NGA curatorial files; X Book, Reel 422 [see also Reel 45, Box 133, folder 1], Duveen Brothers Records, accession number 960015, Research Library, The Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles).



[5] According to Fowles 1976: 127-129, a large collection of Italian paintings was offered on approval to Hamilton by 1920, but he did not purchase them and returned them to Duveen the following year.



[6] In the 1924 New York exhibition the painting was already exhibited as part of the Mackay collection. In 1930, as a consequence of the Depression, Mackay closed his mansion at Roslyn and began to sell his works of art with the assistance of Duveen Brothers (see Fowles 1976: 157). As Bernard Berenson, _Italian Pictures of the Renaissance_, Italian ed., trans. Emilio Cecchi, Milan, 1936: 90, still lists the picture as being in Roslyn, Duveen Brothers must not have acquired it by that year.

Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust, Pittsburgh;[4] gift 1937 to NGA.



[1] The inventory of the Villa di Mezzomonte, dated 1763 (Archivio Corsini, stanza VI, arm. 4, no. 14), describes in the first room on the lawn side, ""un tabernacolo intagliato e dorato in parte e parte tinto di verde entrovi la S.ma Vergine con Gesu Bambino.  Dipinto su asse"" (""a tabernacle in part inlaid and gilded and in part painted green, containing the Holy Virgin and the Child Jesus. Painted on board""). In the transcription of the inventory done by Tommaso Corsini, an annotation indicates that the painting is ""oggi in Galleria"" (""now in the Gallery""). According to Ulderico Medici, _Catalogo della Galleria dei Principi Corsini in Firenze_, Florence, 1880: 65, the painting was moved to Palazzo Corsini in Via del Parione from a Corsini family villa in 1870. Perhaps this is only an approximate date; in any case, in the ""Prospetto della corrispondenza dei diversi inventari (secondo l'ordine dei quadri nel 1872)"" (""Outline of the corresondence between the various inventories [following the order of the pictures in 1872]"") (Archivio Corsini, stanza VI, arm. 4, no. 74), lists ""no. 3 Lippi (?). Madonna a tabernacolo. 1864 Mezzomonte"" (""Madonna in a tabernacle. 1864 [meaning that in this year the painting was still preserved there])."" The painting is not yet listed in the 1727 inventory of that villa.



[2] Tommaso Corsini was a man of vast cultural interests (see Nidia Danelon Vasoli, ""Corsini, Tommaso,"" _Dizionario biografico degli italiani_, 1983: 29:680-683). As soon as he acceded to his title in 1868, he began to reorganize the family's historic gallery, entrusting the task to the sculptor Ulderico Medici, who also prepared the catalogue of the works exhibited. Of this painting, Medici 1880: 56 notes: ""nel 1870 Sua Eccellenza il Principe Don Tommaso lo fece restaurare e dispose che fosse collocato nella di lui Galleria"" (""in 1870 His Excellency Prince Don Tommaso had it restored and placed in his gallery"").



[3] Until 1935 (see Lumachi, _Florence: A New Illustrated Guide_, 2nd ed., 1935: 213) and in some other guides even later, the painting continued to be listed as no. 176 in Room IV of the Corsini Gallery. However, as is documented by the label on the back of the painting, its ownership had already passed by inheritance to Prince Tommaso's daughter Beatrice, who in 1889 married Count Roberto Pandolfini. (The label is only partly legible today and reads ""Prop. B. Pandolfini / Prov. Casa Corsini / Cat. N... Nota N...""  Per a letter of 20 October 1936 from Duveen Brothers' office in Paris to the one in New York, the obscured line originally read ""Cat. N. 858. Nota N. Specale."") Apparently soon after Tommaso Corsini's death his heirs began to negotiate the sale of some paintings from the Gallery; in 1920 a Duveen Brothers agent was invited to examine them in the gallery (see Edward Fowles, _Memories of Duveen Brothers_, London, 1976: 123), but the company did not purchase the Botticelli until 1930. It was by then in the hands of the dealer and restorer Luigi Grassi, who showed it to Bernard Berenson in February 1930; Berenson promptly recommended the purchase to Duveen Brothers (Box 233, Folder 3, Duveen Brothers Records, accession number 960015, Research Library, The Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles; copies in NGA curatorial files).

[1] Information given by E. Brüningk and Andrei Somov, _Ermitage Impérial. Catalogue de la Galerie des Tableaux. Les Écoles d'Italie et d'Espagne_, 3rd ed., Saint Petersburg, 1891: 73: ""d'après le témoignage du baron Vivant Denon."" No reference to an engraver named Peralli could be found in any of the generally used art dictionaries. It is know, however, that Botticelli's small panel _St. Augustine in His Study_ (no. 1473 in the Uffizi in Florence), was acquired in 1779 through Piero Pieralli (see John Fleming, ""The Hugfords in Florence,"" _The Connoisseur_ 136 [1955]: 206). On Denon see the following note.

[2] Actually Brüningk and Somov 1891: 73 say only that the painting was acquired ""par l'entremise"" (""through the intermediation"") of Denon.  It is quite possible, however, that Denon--who, apart from being the creator of the Musée Napoleon, also had a very large private collection of paintings, art objects, and antiquities of his own (see Jean Chatelain, _Dominique Vivant Denon et le Louvre de Napoleon_, Paris, 1973: 260)--was already in possession of _The Adoration of the Magi_ when in 1808 he was entrusted with augmenting the Russian Imperial collections (see Vladimir Levinson-Lessing, _Istoria kartinskoi galerei Ermitaga, 1764-1917_, Leningrad, 1985: 138).

[3] The list of abbreviations for Brüiningk and Somov (1891: xxxv) and Andrei Ivanovich Somov (_Ermitage Impérial. Catalogue de la Galerie des Tableaux. Les Écoles d'Italie et d'Espagne_, 2nd ed., Saint Petersburg, 1899 [3rd ed., 1909]: xxxiv) states that the sign ""A,"" included in the entry relative to the NGA painting, means it was acquired by Czar Paul I (1754-1801). Yet this identification is obviously an error, since besides the fact that Paul I was notoriously un-interested in art collecting, the very date of the acquisition of _The Adoration of the Magi_ for the Hermitage, seven years after the death of Paul I, proves that the painting entered the Imperial collection by request of his successor.

According to John Walker, _Self-Portrait with Donors_, Washington, D.C., 1974: 116, Matthiessen announced to his associates on 9 February 1931 that he had succeeded in buying _The Adoration of the Magi_.  Art periodicals had begun to divulge the information by October 1931 (""Hermitage Art Reported Sold to A.W. Mellon,"" _Art News_ 30 [17 October 1931]: 3, 13, which quotes an article that appeared earlier that month in _The New York Herald Tribune_; see also ""Editorial: Breaking up the Hermitage,"" _The Burlington Magazine_ 63, no. 365 [August 1933]: 53, but the acquisition was officially announced only in 1935 (""Mellon Holdings are Announced by Knoedler & Co.,"" _Art News_ 33, no. 21 [23 February 1935]: 3-5; ""Rundschau. Amerika,"" _Pantheon_ [April 1935]: 150).

[5] The Mellon purchase date and the date deeded to the Mellon Trust are according to Mellon collection records in NGA curatorial files and David Finley's notebook (donated to the National Gallery of Art in 1977, now in the Gallery Archives).

In 2012 The Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles, acquired the M. Knoedler & Co. records (accession number 2012.M.54), and in 2013 processed portions of the archive were first made publicly available. An entry from a January 1931 Knoedler sales book confirms the sale to Mellon (on-line illustration of the sales book page, in Karen Meyer-Roux, ""Treasures from the Vault: Knoedler, Mellon, and an Unlikely Sale,"" _The Getty Iris_ [http://blogs.getty.edu/iris/author/kmeyerroux/], 30 July 2013).

[1] C.J. Nieuwenhuys, _Description de la Galerie des Tableaux de S.M. le Roi des Pays-Bas_, (Brussels, 1843), 2, on the history of the painting says: ""D'après les meilleurs renseignements qu'on a pu obtenir, ce tableau faisait suite à deux autres peintures du même maitre; il a été peint pour _Philippe le Bon, duc de Bourgogne_, et destiné à orner un monument réligieux à Dijon.""  S. Reinach, ""Three Early Panels from the Ducal Residence at Dijon,"" _Burlington Magazine_ 50 (1927), 239, published a fragmentary description written in 1791 of three paintings kept in the Prior's room, but originally in the ducal chapel of the Chartreuse de Champmol. This reads in part:  ""Dans la chambre du Prieur on conserve deux tableaux sur bois dans le genre des premiers peintres flamands, qui proviennent des chapelles [sic] des Ducs: ils ont environ 4 pieds de haut.  Le premier, d'à peu près un pied de large, est un _Annonciation_...""  Although the dimensions do not match those of the Gallery's painting, the general shape is similar and the tall, narrow format is rather unusual for a Netherlandish Annunciation.  Nieuwenhuys' statement that the painting came from Dijon, coupled with the 1791 description, raises the possibility that 1937.1.39 is identical with the painting mentioned as being in the Chartreuse de Champmol.  The manuscript is in the Bibliothèque Publique, Dijon, Ms.  88, fol. 53.

[1] Possibly commissioned by his sister Isabella d'Este; final payment made to Bellini by Alfonso in 1514; painting located in Camerino d'Alabastro of the Castello until 1598.

[2] Giovan was the son of Olimpia Aldobrandini by her second marriage, to Camillo Pamphili; upon his inheritance, Giovan changed his name to Aldobrandini.  His brother Cardinal Benedetto [d. 1730] also inherited some paintings.

[3] In 1760, the paintings were involved in a lawsuit between the Colonna and Borghese, and were settled on the second son of the head of the Borghese in 1769.

[5] Cabral was Northumberland's attorney in Rome; he negotiated the transaction with Camuccini; a seal with what is probably his coat-of-arms is on the back of the painting.  See Anderson 1993, 269-270. 

[6] The painting is number J1755 in Agnew's records (see Thos. Agnew & Sons, Picture Stock Book, 1904-1933, Section 2 [which records paintings purchased jointly by Agnew and a partner]; NGA27/1/1/10, Research Centre, National Gallery, London; copy in NGA curatorial files; digitized and available at https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/research/research-centre/agnews-stock-books, accessed 17 May 2017).

[7] Although the painting was exhibited in 1920 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art as from the collection of Carl W. Hamilton, New York, he probably only had it on credit, as he had many paintings from Duveen Brothers, Inc. on the same basis. According to a history of the Widener collection written by Edith Standen, the Widener curator, Joseph Widener ""would not have the Bellini listed as having passed through the Carl Hamilton Collection...because, he said, Mr. Hamilton never completed the payments on it."" She also wrote that Widener ""said the Duke of Northumberland tried to sell him the picture before World War I."" (Handwritten manuscript and typed copy, Edith Standen Papers, Gallery Archives, National Gallery of Art, Washington; copy in NGA curatorial files.) 

     The painting is not recorded as sold in Agnew's records until 1922 (see note 6). However, Arthur Sulley appears to have handled the sale to Widener. Sulley wrote to the collector about the painting in 1917, and his letter of 26 September 1921 to Widener states that the painting will be delivered around 10 October 1921 (both letters in NGA curatorial files).",Widener Collection,Painting,,painting,,0,CIS-R,,,,,2024-01-26 22:01:48.797-05,Q15008032,https://customprints.nga.gov/detail/461333/bellini-the-feast-of-the-gods-15141529

[1] Whereas in similar compositions the armrest of Mary's throne has only a generic decoration, in NGA 1943.4.47 it bears what would seem to be the coat of arms of the Medici with six _torteaux_. As the king of France in 1465 permited Piero de' Medici to add to his coat of arms a seventh _torteau_ decorated with _fleurs de lis_, its absence could indicate a _terminus ante quem_ for the execution of the work. See Roy Brogan, _A Signature of Power and Patronage: the Medici Coat of Arms, 1299-1492_, Ph.D. diss., Florida State University, 1978 (Ann Arbor, Michigan, 1981: 156).



[2] The 1885 sale catalogue of the collection of Baron E. de Beurnonville (Paris, Féral, Lasquin; c.p. Chevalier, 30-31 June 1885, no. 240) includes a painting, cited also in two earlier sales of the same collection in 1883 and 1884, described as ""La Vierge aux anges avec fond de paysage"" (""the Virgin with angels and a landscape background"") and attributed to Filippo Lippi. The identity of the subject and the attribution match those that accompanied NGA 1943.4.47 when it was offered for sale by Sedelmeyer in Paris (see note 4) and suggests that the two listings may refer to the same painting, although the measurements given in the de Beurnonville catalogue (79 x 51 cm) are different.

[1] The picture is first certainly recorded in the Chelsea house of  Anne Russell Digby, Countess of Bristol [d. 1696/1697], mother-in-law of Lord Sunderland, by John Evelyn on 15 January 1679 (John Evelyn, _The Diary of John Evelyn (1620–1706)_, ed. Esmond S. de Beer, 6 vols., Oxford, 1955: 4:162). Yet although Sunderland inherited a few family portraits from his mother-in-law, he acquired most of his extensive collection during his diplomatic career, including in Italy (Kenneth Garlick, “A Catalogue of Pictures at Althorp,” _Walpole Society_ 45 [1974-1976]: xiii-xiv); and according to Thomas F. Dibdin, _Aedes Althorpianae: An Account of the Mansion, Books and Pictures at Althorp_, London, 1822: 13, the _Venus and Adonis_ was one of Sunderland's favorite purchases. In 1685, still in the lifetime of Lady Bristol, Evelyn saw the picture again at Sunderland’s house in Whitehall (Evelyn 1955, 4:403). Harold Wethey repeats a theory that the picture is identical with a _Venus and Adonis_ mentioned by Marco Boschini, in the Palazzo Barbarigo della Terrazza in Venice, and which is sometimes supposed to have been acquired by Cristoforo Barbarigo soon after Titian’s death from his son Pomponio; see Harold Wethey, _The Paintings of Titian_, 3 vols., London, 1969-1975: 3(1975):193–194; and Marco Boschini, _La Carta del Navegar Pitoresco_ (1660), ed. Anna Pallucchini, Venice, 1966: 30, 664. But apart from the fact that Cristoforo’s will of 1600, which does mention the Gallery’s _Venus with a Mirror_ (NGA 1937.1.34), makes no mention of any _Venus and Adonis_, Siebenhüner demonstrated that the Barbarigo version was of an upright format, was still in Venice in 1793/1795, was sold to the Czar of Russia in 1850, and is now lost. See Herbert Siebenhüner, _Der Palazzo Barbarigo della Terrazza in Venedig und seine Tizian-Sammlung_, Munich, 1981: 30; and also Fern Rusk Shapley, _Catalogue of the Italian Paintings_, 2 vols., Washington, 1979: 1:495.

[1] This may be deduced from a drawing after the painting.  Mr. E. Kersley, in a letter of 17 June 1961 to John Walker in the NGA curatorial files, places the drawing in or near Arundel based on its original position in a sketchbook of primarily topographical scenes.  Attributed to the English artist William Henry Brooke (1772-1860), this drawing is now in the National Gallery of Art (1983.48.1).

The second letter informed Guiffrey that the painting was ""out of a small unknown collection, and as such has no pedigree."" See also Gustav Glück, _Brueghels Gemälde_ (Vienna, 1932), 57.

[4] A letter from William Suida to the Baron of 25 October 1951 in the Kress files requests the Baron's written confirmation that he once owned the painting, and that he sold it through an agent to the Kress Foundation: ""The Foundation bought the painting through Messrs.

[1] The inventory made of the artist's estate in 1614 included two examples of ""a small Laocoön"" (""Un laocon pequeño) and one large painting of this subject (""Un laocon grande"").  Francisco de Borja de San Román y Fernández, _El Greco en Toledo_, Madrid, 1910: 193.  Because the measurements of the Kress painting correspond most closely to those of the smallest of the versions cited in the inventory of 1621 (see n. 2 below), it seems likely that the Kress painting was one of the two small versions recorded in 1614. 

[2] The inventory made of the possessions of Jorge Manuel in 1621 includes the following items: ""41 Un laocon, de dos baras de largo y bara y dos terzias de alto"" (""A Laocoön of two _varas_ in width and one and two-thirds of a _vara_ in height""); ""179 Un laocon grande, de tres baras y media en quadrado"" (""A large Laocoön, three and one-half _varas_ square""); ""180 Otro laocon, casi del mismo Tamaño"" (""Another Laocoön, almost the same size""); see Francisco de Borja de San Román y Fernández, ""De la vida del Greco,"" _Archivo Español de Arte y Arqueologia_ 3 (1927): 291, 301.  Because a _vara_ equals approximately 84 cm., the measurements of no.  41 correspond closely to those of the Kress painting. The difference in the numbers of large and small versions of the subject mentioned in the two inventories suggest that Jorge Manuel sold one of the two smaller paintings in his father's estate and that he or another artist in the workshop produced another large copy of the composition before 1621.  Alternatively, a mistake may have been made in one of the inventories.  Many previous scholars have maintained that the Kress painting was in the Spanish royal collection in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries:  Manuel B. Cossío, _El Greco_, Madrid, 1908: 362; Emilio H. del Villar, _El Greco en España_, Madrid, 1928: 132; Walter S. Cook, ""El Greco's _Laocoön_ in the National Gallery,"" _Gazette des Beaux-Arts_ 26 (1944): 262, n. 1; José Camón Aznar, _Domenico Greco_ , Madrid, 1950: 2:921; Harold E. Wethey, _El Greco and His School_, Princeton, 1962: 2:84, no. 127; Colin Eisler, _Paintings from the Samuel H. Kress Collection: European Schools Excluding Italian_, Oxford, 1977: 198, no. K1413; William B.  Jordan, _El Greco of Toledo_ [exh. cat.] (1982-1983), 257, no. 56.  However, it is likely that the royal inventories refer not to the Kress painting but to one of the larger versions cited in the 1621 inventory (nos. 179 and 180).  The relevant entries are as follows:  Alcázar, Madrid, Inventory of 1666, no. 520: ""3 varas casi en quadro de Lauconte y sus hijos de mano del Greco en 300 dicadps de plata"" (""3 _varas_, almost square, of Laocoön and his sons, by the hand of El Greco, at 300 silver _ducados_""). Harold E. Wethey, letter, 22 June 1969, NGA curatorial files.  Alcázar, Madrid, Inventory of 1686, no. 310: ""Un quadro de tres baras de largo casi quadrado de la Oconte y sus hijos de blanco y negro de mano del Griego, tiene Marco negro como las demas pinturas de esta pieza"" (""A painting, three _varas_ in width, almost square, of Laocoön and his sons, in white and black by the hand of El Greco, has a black frame like the other paintings in this room"").  Yves Bottineau, ""L'Alcázar de Madrid et l'inventaire de 1686: aspects de la cour d'Espagne au XVIIe siècle,"" _Bulletin Hispanique_ 60 (1958), 164.  Alcázar, Madrid, Inventory of 1701-1703, no. 119: ""Un cuadro de tres varas de largo quasi quadrado de laoconte y sus hijos de blanco y negro de mano del Griego con marco negro tasado en cien Doblons"" (""A painting three _varas_ in width, almost square, of Laocoön and his sons, in white and black by the hand of El Greco, with a black frame valued at 100 _doblones_"").  Gloria Fernández Bayton, ed., _Inventarios reales:  Testamentario del Rey Carlos II_, 6 vols., Madrid, 1975-: 1:29.  The dimensions given in all these inventories correspond to the now lost larger versions of the Laocoön but not to the Kress painting.    The Kress painting has also been related to references in the royal inventories of 1701-1703 and 1791 to an approximately square painting of Laocoön, about two _varas_ across, said to be a copy of Titian.  The width of this painting approximates that of the Kress painting.  However, it seems most unlikely that the Kress painting would have been described as a copy of Titian, especially because an original _Laocoön_ by El Greco and the copy after Titian were recorded in the royal collections at the same time (Fernández Bayton 1975-, 1:29, no. 119; 2:324, no. 581).  Spanish critics of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries carefully distinguished the styles of Titian and El Greco, and the compilers of the royal inventories probably would not have confused them.  See, e. g. Antonio Palomino de Castro y Velasco, _El Museo pictórico y escala óptica_,1715 and 1724, reprint ed., Madrid, 1947: 841; and Antonio Ponz, _Viaje de España_, ed. C.

Because this painting was owned by the dealer Cassirer in 1915, this supposition is unlikely.  However, the painting may have been purchased by Fischer's wife before their marriage in 1919.  Frau von Schwabach may possibly have been an earlier owner, unrelated to Fischer.

[1] The portrait is recorded in an inventory of the pictures in the Palazzo Farnese drawn up in 1644 as follows: “4324. Un quadro in tela con cornice grande intagliata a basso relievo et indorata, con il ritratto del S.r cardinale S. Angelo giovanetto con l’habito di Malta, mano di Titiano.” See Bertrand Jestaz, ed., _L’inventaire du Palais et des propriétés Farnèse à Rome en 1644, Vol. 3, Pt. 3: Le Palais Farnèse_, Rome, 1994: 171. It is again recorded there in an inventory of 1653: see Giuseppe Bertini, _La Galleria del Duca di Parma: Storia di una collezione_, Bologna, 1987: 89.

[2] A Farnese inventory of 1680 describes the picture as follows: “Ritratto di un giovinetto vestito di rosso con sopraveste nera sopra della quale la croce di Cavaliere di Malta: tiene nella destra un guanto di _Tiziano_.” See: Amadeo Ronchini, “Delle relazioni di Tiziano coi Farnesi,” _Atti e memorie delle RR Deputazioni di Storia Patria per le Provincie Modenesi e Parmensi_ 2 (1864): 145; Giuseppe Campori, _Raccolta di cataloghi ed inventarii inediti_, Modena, 1870: 239; Giuseppe Bertini, _La Galleria del Duca di Parma: Storia di una collezione_, Bologna, 1987: 89.

[4] The Farnese collection was transferred to Naples in 1734, probably initially to the Palazzo Reale, when it was inherited by Charles of Bourbon, king of Naples.

[5] Jérôme de Lalande, _Voyage d’un français en Italie fait dans les années 1765 et 1766_, 8 vols., Paris, 1769: 6:174; see also Giuseppe Sigismondo, _Descrizione della città di Napoli e suoi borghi_, 3 vols., Naples, 1788-1789: 3(1789):48. As pointed out by M. Utili (_I Farnese: Arte e collezionismo_, eds. Lucia Fornari Schianchi and Nicola Spinosa, exh. cat. Palazzo Ducale, Colorno; Galleria Nazionale di Capodimonte, Naples; Haus der Kunst, Munich; Milan, 1995: 206), the picture was probably transferred from the Palazzo Reale to the Palazzo di Capodimonte as part of the reorganization of the royal collection undertaken by Padre Giovanni Maria della Torre between 1756 and 1764.

[6] A. Filangieri di Candida, “La galleria nazionale di Napoli,” _Le gallerie nazionali iItaliane_ 5 (1902): 304, no. 34. As pointed out by M. Utili (see note 5), the picture is probably identical with a “ritratto di giovane di Tiziano,” carried off to Rome in 1799 by French troops, together with other pictures from the royal collection, but returned to Naples before 1802. 

[7] According to the inventory compiled by Paterno in 1816, quoted by M. Utili (see note 5). The picture appears to have left the Bourbon collection soon afterwards.

[8] According to Tancred Borenius, Sir Francis Cook acquired the painting through Sir George Donaldson. See: Tancred Borenius, _A Catalogue of the Paintings at Doughty House, Richmond, and Elsewhere in the Collection of Sir Frederick Cook Bt.: Italian Schools. Vol. I, Pt. 2_, ed. Herbert Cook, London, 1913: 170.

[9] According to Robinson's account book (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford; copy of relevant page in NGA curatorial files). Robinson, in “The Gallery of Pictures of Old Masters, formed by Francis Cook, Esq., of Richmond,” _The Art Journal_ (1885): 136, records the picture in the Cook collection, and reports that it had been “brought to England a few years ago by an Italian gentleman from Naples.”

[1] From the coat-of-arms at the lower left, there would seem to be little doubt that the Gallery's panel was first owned and probably executed for a member of the Haller family of Nuremberg; see Otto Titan von Hefner and Gustav Adelbert Seyler, _die Wappen des bayerischen Adels. J. Siebmacher's grosses Wappenbuch_. 34 vols. (Neustadt an der Aisch, 1971) 22: 38, pl. 36, and additional information in NGA manuscript for systematic catalogue number 5 on German painting, entry on _Madonna and Child_ by Dürer.  The Hallers were one of Nuremberg's largest and most influential patrician families, but our inability to identify the coat-of-arms at the lower right renders it all but impossible to find a candidate.  The direction of the Haller arms is reversed so that it may ""respect"" the arms of what is presumed to be the wife's family at the lower right; see Gustav A. Seyler, ""die Orientirung der Wappen"", _Geschichte der Heraldik. J. Siebmacher's grosses Wappenbuch_. vols. A-G (Neustadt an der Aisch, 1970) A: 454-487, and letter of 16 April 1988 from Walter Angst to John Hand in NGA curatorial file.  Anzelewsky raised the possibility that the panel was painted for Wilhelm Haller (d. 1534) whose second marriage to Dorothea Landauer took place in 1497; see Fedja Anzelewsky, _Albrecht Dürer Das malerische Werk_. (Berlin, 1971), 142.  On the other hand, Sally E. Mansfield suggested, in a report in the NGA curatorial file, Hieronymus II Haller (d. 1519) who married Catharina Wolf von Wolfstal in 1419.



[2] Christophe Gottlieb von Murr, _Beschreibung der vornehmsten Merkwürdigkeiten in des H.R. Reichs freyen Stadt Nürnberg und auf der hohen Schule zu Altdorf_ (Nuremberg, 1778), 476. ""Von einem unberkannten sehr alten Meister. N. 239 Lot eilet mit seinen Töchtern aus Sodom. Man siehet unter andern auch ein Marienbild angebracht. Auf Holz."" Listed as belonging to the ""Praunisches Museum."" The suggestion, which remains unverified, that this refers to the Gallery's painting was first made by Erika Tietze, letter of 4 February 1953 to Fern Rusk Shapley, in curatorial files. In Murr's later catalogue of the collection, however, the painting is given to Joachim Patinir. See Christophe Theophile de Murr, _Description du Cabinet de Monsieur Paul de Praun a Nuremberg_ (Nuremberg, 1797), 31, ""Joachim Patenier, 239. Lot et ses deux Filles sortans de Sodome. Les figures sont comme decoupées, sans justes ombres. Sur bois. Albret Durer reçut ce petit Tableau en 1521 à Anvers par le Sécretaire de cette Ville... haut 8 p. larg. 8 p."" The Dimensions in _pouces_, approximately 8x8 inches, do not correspond to those of the Gallery's panel, and a verso is not described, suggesting that a different painting had been assigned the same catalogue number. The Praun collection was dispersed in sales of 1797 and 1802; see Th. Hampe, ""Kunstfreunde im alten Nürnberg und ihre Sammlungen,"" _Festschrift des Vereins für Geschichte der Stadt Nürnberg zur Feier seines 25 jähr. Bestehens_ (Nuremberg, 1903), 82-87.  Colin Eisler, _Paintings from the Samuel H. Kress Collection: European Schools Excluding Italian_ (Oxford, 1977), 14, listed Willibald Imhoff the Elder [d.1580] of Nuremberg as a possible owner.  Although there are several images of the Madonna or of the burning of Sodom and Gomorrah listed in the Imhoff inverntories, they are not, however, conjoined or described in enough detail to permit identification with the Gallery's picture. By the same token, it is not possible to verify the interesting suggestion in Eisler 1977, 16, n. 46, that the Gallery's panel might be the ""Marienbild von Albrecht Dürer"" belonging to both the Imhoff and Praun collections. See Joseph Heller, _Das Leben und die Werke Albrecht Dürer's_ (Bamberg, 1827) vol. 2, part 1, 78, no. 1 (Imhoff), 230-231, no. y (Praun). There is also some question as to whether the many works listed as by Dürer in the Imhoff collection were autograph or deliberate falsification; see Moriz Thausing, _Dürer, Geschichte seines Lebens und seiner Kunst_ (Leipzig, 1876), 141-144 (Engl. trans. _Albert Dürer, His Life and Works_. Fred A. Eaton Ed., 2 vols., London 1882, 1: 184-188).



[3] This and the preceding are unverified, but are first cited in Max J. Friedländer, ""Eine Unbekannte Dürer-Madonna."" _Pantheon_ 14 (1934): 322, who states that Loder purchased the painting from à Court Repington, repeated in Rudolf Heinemann, _Stiftung Sammlung Schloss Rohoncz. I. Teil. Verzeichnis der Gemälde_. (Lugano-Castagnola, 1937), 47, no. 127, and accepted by later authors. For Charles à Court Repington see the article by J.E. Edmonds, _The Dictionary of National Biography_ (Oxford and London), Supplement 1922-1930, 717-718. That he dealt in pictures on occasion is stated in Mary Repington, _Thanks for the Memory_ (London, 1938), 223, 278. No information has come to light concerning Phyllis Loder. There is no justification for the assertation in Denys Sutton, ""Robert Langton Douglas. Part IV,"" _Apollo_ CX, no. 209 (July, 1979): 205, that the picture was once owned by Robert Langton Douglas.

A note in the NGA provenance card file suggests that the panel passed from Vaz Dias to the dealer Bottenwieser in Berlin, but it has not been possible to verify this.

Colnaghi, London). (Howard Young Galleries, New York), in 1930. William R. Timken [1866-1949], New York, by 1933;[4] by inheritance to his widow, Lillian Guyer Timken [1881-1959], New York; bequest 1960 to NGA.


[1] The transfer of ownership from the Corner family to Kauffmann by way of Udny is documented by a letter of 1788 from Gavin Hamilton to the dealer G.M. Sasso in Venice. Hamilton mentions that Angelica Kauffmann (Zucchi) owned “un bel quadro di ritratti di casa Cornaro di Tiziano. Ha sofferto ed è molto ridipinto, ma è stato bello. Era di mister Udny, e facilmente è uscito da questa casa” (A beautiful portrait of members of the Corner family by Titian. It is very damaged and has been much repainted, but it has been beautiful. It formerly belonged to Mr Udny, who acquired it without difficulty from the family); see Francesca Del Torre, “Gavin Hamilton a Giovanni Maria Sasso,” in _Lettere artistiche del Settecento veneziano_, ed. Alessandro Bettagno and Marina Magrini, 4 vols., Vicenza, 2002-2009: 1(2002):450-451. Kauffmann herself mentions the picture in her will of 1803: “A fine painting by Titian, three half-figures, portraits of the old family Cornaro of Venice” (Victoria Manners and George Charles Williamson, _Angelica Kauffman, R. A.: Her Life and Her Works_, London, 1924: 244). The identification of the subject as three members of the Corner family in half-length, the attribution to Titian, and the mention of the poor condition of the picture together make it virtually certain that it is identical with the Gallery’s picture.

[2] The gift, recorded in the inscription on the back of the painting, was made following Canova’s meeting with Hamilton in Paris in 1815. Hamilton, British Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, played a leading role in forcing the French government to return many of the artistic spoils seized by Napoleon from the papal states; and in token of his gratitude, Canova presented to him not only the NGA picture, but one of his _Ideal Heads_ (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, 1996.395), and a handsomely bound volume of engravings after Titian (Katherine Eustace, ed., _Canova: Ideal Heads_, Oxford, 1997: 30 n. 76; Giuseppe Pavanello, “La collezione di Antonio Canova: Dipinti e disegni dal Quattrocento all’Ottocento,” in _Antonio Canova e il suo ambiente artístico fra Venezia, Roma e Parigi_, ed. Giuseppe Pavanello, Venice, 2000: 334). Presumably Canova acquired the picture from the estate of Kauffmann, who had died in 1807 (see note 1).

Robinson indicated that he had bought the version of the _Expulsion_ now in London from the Marqués de Salamanca in Madrid ""some 15 or 20 years ago"".  Because other evidence indicates that the London painting could not have been obtained in Madrid, Maclaren suggests that Robinson may have purchased the Washington version (which the baronet also once owned) from the Marqués de Salamanca.

[1]  Listed no. 255 in the Andries Bonger stock list of 1890 as ‘Jeune fille en blanc’ (12). This is a reference to a size 12 figure canvas which measured 61 x 50 cm. The painting is now considered to have been painted on a size 15 marine canvas, which measured 65 x 45 cm., Van Gogh, for his own artistic reasons, wanting to exploit the less orthodox, more elongated shape. This slight discrepancy in the canvas size is understandable given that Bonger’s assessments were presumably being made by eye alone.

[1] Assuming this is the painting referred to in the chronology published in _Gauguin: Tahiti_, Exh. cat., Galerie nationales du Grand Palais, Paris; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, 2004: 347.

The painting was lent by Ernest Rouart to the 1906 Salon d'Automne. Ernest was the son of collector Henri Rouart and inherited with his siblings his father's collection. The collection was dispersed at auctions in Paris in 1912 and 1913, none of which included this Gauguin. Neither was it included in an anonymous sale of some of Ernest Rouart's collection held 22-23 March 1918 in Paris.

[2] Horch was the financial backer of the first Roerich Museum on Riverside Drive, New York City, that existed between 1924-1938. Chester Dale's papers, copy in NGA curatorial files, record the Roerich Museum as his source for the Gauguin, but this is crossed out and Horch written in.

See Dominique Lobstein, ""Die Ausstellung Paul Gauguin in der Galerie Barbazanges im Jahre 1919,"" in _Paul Gauguin: Vom der Bretagne nach Tahiti. Ein Aufbruch zur Moderne_, Exh. cat., Landesmuseum Joanneum, Graz, 2000. The painting is reproduced in Louise Gebhard Cann, ""Gauguin's Image of Himself,"" _International Studio_ 82 (May 1925): 120, with Hodebert in the caption, although the picture would have left Hodebert by 1923, when it was sold to Reid & Lefèvre. Hodebert was the successor to the Galerie Barbazanges, which was located on the property of fashion designer Paul Poiret. Poiret went bankrupt in the early 1920s and it is probably at that time that the gallery changed ownership/name.

[5] The Stang collection was visited in January 1929 by Cesar de Hauke and Germain Seligmann, per the Seligmann papers, Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington: Box 208. The collection was described, and this painting reproduced, by Paul Jamot in ""L'Art français en Norvège,"" _La Renaissance_ (February 1929). This painting, however, was already sold by Dr. Alfred Gold to Reid & Lefèvre by that time. See Reid & Lefèvre, Paintings Sold, sheet no. 161, #312/28 B1343, which records the date of purchase from Gold as 3 January 1928 (Lefèvre archives, Hyman Kreitman Research Centre, Tate Britain, London, TGA 2002/11, Box 283).

[6] The invoice dated 5 April 1929 from Bignou to Reid & Lefèvre for the re-framing of the painting suggests it was in Paris by that time (Lefèvre archives, Hyman Kreitman Research Centre, Tate Britain, London, TGA 2002/11, Box 180). On 29 May 1929, Bignou writes that he has shipped the picture to London (Lefèvre archives, Hyman Kreitman Research Centre, Tate Britain, London, TGA 2002/11, Box 218).

[1] The name ""Ginevra"" was too common in the Renaissance to assume with Jean Adhémar (""Une galerie de portraits italiens à Amboise en 1500,"" _Gazette des Beaux Arts_ 86, no. 1281 (October 1975): 100), followed by Fern Rusk Shapley (_Catalogue of the Italian Paintings_, 2 vols., Washington, D.C., 1979: 1:251-255), that a portrait of a lady so named in an inventory made at Amboise in 1500 refers to Leonardo's painting, which the early sources, to the contrary, place in Florence. It is not known whether the painting belonged to the Benci family in the early sixteenth century, as Antonio Billi (_Il Libro di Antonio Billi esistente in due copie nella Biblioteca nazionale di Firenze_, ed. Carl Frey, Berlin, 1892: 51), who presumably saw it, does not give its location. 

     The picture may well have entered the Liechtenstein Collection by 1712 or earlier, as the 1733 red wax seal on the reverse, bearing the Liechtenstein arms, designated works that were part of the ""Fideikommissgalerie"" of Prince Johann Adam, held in trust but not personally collected by the then-reigning Prince Josef Wenzel (1696-1772) (see Reinhold Baumstark, ""Collecting Paintings,"" in _Liechtenstein, The Princely Collections_, exh. cat., The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 1985: 183-185). The founder of the picture gallery at Feldsberg was Prince Karl Eusebius (1611-1684), a distinguished connoisseur who liked small cabinet-type paintings. He was succeeded by his son, the already mentioned Prince Johann Adam, also an avid collector who, however, preferred the Italian Baroque. Either could have obtained the painting in Florence, where both traveled (Olga Raggio, ""The Collection of Sculpture,"" in _Liechtenstein, The Princely Collections_, exh. cat., The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 1985: 63-65). Leonardo's authorship, in any case, came to be forgotten, as the panel was attributed to Lucas Cranach in the Liechtenstein Catalogue of 1780.

[2] During World War II the picture was transferred, with the rest of the collection, from the Garden Palace in Vienna to the castle at Vaduz in the principality of Liechtenstein, and from there it was acquired from Prince Franz Josef II for the National Gallery of Art.

Details about Gaston Bernheim de Villers' ownership and his sale of the painting to Molyneux are in a letter of 22 June 1977, from Jean Dauberville at Bernheim-Jeune & Cie. to David Rust, in NGA curatorial files. Although the painting was included in an exhibition at Reid and Lefevre in 1934, and a photograph album in their records includes the painting (with the names ""M. Ackermann, Paris"" and ""Bernheim-Jeune, Paris"" under provenance), it is not certain Reid and Lefevre actually owned it. More likely is the possibility that Molyneux purchased the painting from Bernheim de Villers out of the 1934 exhibition, with the sale handled by Bernheim-Jeune Gallery and/or Reid and Lefevre. (Martin Bailey has kindly shared his research on this part of the provenance; see his letter of 22 August 2003, in NGA curatorial files.) The sequence of ownership after Mme van Gogh-Bonger that is given by J.-B. de la Faille in _The Works of Vincent van Gogh, His Paintings and Drawings_, Amsterdam, 1970: no. F565, i.e., Bernheim-Jeune, Reid and Lefevre, Ackermann, Molyneux, is apparently in error.

[1] Per Roseline Bacou, ‘Paul Gauguin et Gustave Fayet’, in _Gauguin, Actes du colloque Gauguin_, Musée d’Orsay, 11–13 janvier 1989, p. 25.  Bacou, an art historian and granddaughter of the collector Gustave Fayet, gives Schuffenecker as the first owner of this painting, although the circumstances and timing of its acquisition are lacking. Schuffenecker parted with it around the time of his divorce, when he was obliged to see much of his collection go to his half-brother Amédée, from whom it must have been acquired by Gustave Fayet. Previously the work was believed to have been included in the Gauguin sale at the Hôtel des Ventes, Paris, 18 February 1895, no. 44 or 47. However, no. 44 is listed as _Paysage_, and was bought in by Gauguin, and no. 47, _Paysage Breton_ was bought by M. Carbonneau.
  
[2] Fayet was a wealthy wine grower, an amateur painter, a collector, and friend of artists, who had a number of Van Goghs and Gauguins in his possession. At the time of Gauguin’s death in 1903, Fayet’s Gauguin collection had already grown to a significant size. _Haystacks_ was added by 1904 at the latest, being among the several Breton works that, according to Bacou, Fayet bought from Schuffenecker between 1903 and 1904. It is visible in a photograph taken by Druet of his Paris residence, 51 rue de Bellechasse, the earliest date for which would be January 1905. In 1908, when he and his wife acquired the Abbey of Fontfroide, he sold some of the collection. However, this painting is visible in a photograph of the interior of Fayet's Château d'Igny, dated c. 1914. He kept it until his death in September 1925. Earlier that year J.-G. Goulinat visited Fayet and wrote a profile of his collection (""Les Collections Gustave Fayet,"" _L'Amour de l'Art_ 6 (1925): 131-142). As the critic confessed, the size of the collection made it impossible for him to realise his initial ambition of enumerating all the important works in the collection, so Haystacks is not named.

[3] Brooks purchased the painting around 1925, possibly at the Fayet sale.
 
[4] According to the Marie Harriman Gallery inventory card in NGA curatorial files, Mrs. Brooks sold this and six other objects to Harriman in June 1936.

[1] Lent by Bernheim-Jeune to 1910-1911 exhibition at Grafton Galleries, London.

[2] Goetz was a German national whose property was sequestered by the French government during the First World War and sold at this 1922 auction. The purchaser, according to the annotated copy of the sales catalogue in the Knoedler library [Knoedler microfiche, French no. 0896], was ""Grunewald."" This likely refers to Isaac Grünewald, a Swedish artist who had gone to Paris in 1908 to study with Matisse and was part of a group of German and German-speaking artists in Paris, including Goetz, who gathered at the Café du Dôme before WWI (see  _Pariser Begegnungen 1904-1914_, exh. cat. Duisburg, 1965, and Annette Gautherie-Kampka, _Les Allemands du Dôme_,  Bern, 1995.)  Grünewald, who took over Goetz's Paris studio in 1921, quite possibly purchased the painting for Goetz, as it was the latter who then later sold it through Dr. Alfred Gold in 1929. Goetz returned to France after WWI and rebuilt his collection before moving to New York in 1939. According to Henri Dorra and John Rewald's catalogue raisonné of Seurat's paintings, no. 168, Goetz had tried to donate this picture to the Louvre at the outbreak of hostilities in 1914, but it was refused.

See also correspondence between de Hauke and Dr. Alfred Gold regarding Gold's commission, and Gold's correspondence with Goetz, in Seligmann papers, box 394 (copies in NGA curatorial files).

[4] The painting was still on de Hauke's books when his gallery closed, and its association with Seligmann dissolved, in 1931. It was then on joint account with Seligmann and Alex Reid & Lefèvre until its sale in 1934. Reid & Lefèvre Paintings Sold, sheet no. 248, #116/29 B1572 gives acquisition source as Wilhelm Lowenstein. However, Gold's correspondence with Richard Goetz (see n. 3 above) makes it clear that Goetz still owned the painting in 1929; perhaps Lowenstein acted as an intermediary.

[1] It seems likely that The Flower Beds in Holland was among the works that the artist abandoned in Nuenen when he made his precipitate departure for Antwerp in late 1885. These works were moved to Breda in 1886, when Van Gogh’s mother and sister Willemina moved to the town, and put in storage with a Breda carpenter, Adrianus Schrauwen. In 1902, although not their legal owner, Schrauwen sold a number of works to the brothers Couvreur, dealers in old furniture in Breda, who swiftly passed them to Kees Mouwen, a military clothing dealer, who seems to have jointly owned them with Willem van Bakel. From that source they were entrusted to the owner of the Oldenzeel gallery, Margareta Wilhelmina Oldenzeel-Schot, who exhibited them in 1904.

[2] John James Enthoven was the son of van Gogh collector Lodewijk Cornelis Enthoven [1854-1920], but this painting was actually owned first by Jan Smit, Lodewijk's father-in-law and John's grandfather, from whose sale it was acquired by John Enthoven (annotated copy of sales catalogue in NGA curatorial files). On the Enthovens and van Gogh, see _Lodewijk Cornelis Enthoven, Verzamelaar te Voorburg_, exh. cat., Museum Museum Swaensteyn, Voorburg, 2004, and Jos ten Berge, ""The Enthoven mystery,"" in _The paintings of Vincent van Gogh in the collection of the Kröller-Müller Museum_, Otterlo, 2003: 424-427 (copies NGA curatorial files). 

[3]  According to a 1954 letter from Brinkman to de la Faille, in the documentation files of the van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, the painting was with Brinkman at that time.

The NGA picture was not included in the 25 November 1918 Curel estate sale held at the Galerie Georges Petit (originally scheduled for 3 May 1918). The vicomte de Curel, for whom the painting was purchased, has been identified by François Auffret, Président of La Société des Amis de Jongkind in Paris (founded 1970), with confirmation from the collector's descendants. With M. Auffret's kind permission, his research was shared with the NGA by Dr. Diana Kostyrko (see her e-mails from October through December 2008 in NGA curatorial files).

[2] According to press coverage of the 1961 sale, the picture had been in the collection of Barbara Church, an American collector who lived in Ville-d'Avray and had died the preceding year. However, the sale in which the NGA painting figured actually consisted of six pictures from the de Curel collection; the Barbara Church sale, held the same day at the Palais Galliera, was one of several estate sales of the Church collection held in 1961.

[1] The artist's heirs were René De Gas, his last surviving brother, who lived in Paris, and the four (of seven) surviving children of his sister Marguerite, who had died in Argentina in 1895. (His other deceased sister Thérèse left no descendants.) Marguerite's children were: Jeanne Fevre, unmarried and acting on both her own behalf and as the representative of her sister, Madeleine Marie Pauline Fevre, a Carmelite nun; Henri Jean Auguste Marie Fevre, an industrialist who lived in Marseille; and Gabriel Edgar Eugène Fevre, an agent in Montevideo, Uruguay.  See Anne Pingeot and Frank Horvat, _Degas sculptures_, Paris, 1991, and Anne Pingeot, ""The casting of Degas' sculptures: Completing the story,"" _Apollo_ (August 1995): 60-63.



[2] On 13 May 1918 a contract was signed between the artist's heirs and the Hébrard foundry authorizing the reproduction of Degas' sculptures in bronze.  Of the approximately 150 statuettes found in the artist's studio after his death, 74 figures were ultimately cast in bronze.  The contract stipulated that two complete sets were to be cast, one for the heirs and one for the foundry, and authorized a limit of twenty casts of each figure to be offered for sale.  The casting process took at least thirteen years, from 1919 to 1932, and according to the contract, the original figures became the property of the foundry.  See Sara Campbell, ""Degas' bronzes: Introduction,"" _Apollo_ (August 1995): 6-10.

Thea Sternheim, wife of the German playwright Carl Sternheim, writes in her diary that they saw the portrait on exhibition in Rotterdam in 1910, lent by Tutein Nolthenius.
