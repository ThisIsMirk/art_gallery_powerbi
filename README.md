# art_gallery_powerbi
A Digital Art Gallery displaying works of renowned artists. Data from [National Gallery of Art.](https://github.com/NationalGalleryOfArt/opendata/tree/main)

_Note: The maps visualization does not work on the public version of the dashboard. This is what the dashboard looks like with all elements working as expected:_

### Data
Data was downloaded from the National Gallery of Art GitHub repository called 'opendata'. Tables provided looked like this (only including data used in the dashboard): 

- Artists: artistid, name, country
- Objects (artwork): objectid, title, displaydate, medium
- ArtistObject connects the Artist and Objects tables.
- Images: objectid, iiifurl

The dataset is massive and included numerous other tables but to scale it down for this dashboard I only selected the ones above. The schema looked like this:

I obtained a list of renowned artists and filtered all the tables to only include data associated with those artists. In total, the gallery displays works of 38 artists. For the dashboard, I wanted to include a short bio of the artist and a picture, these were not included in the data. For the picture, I used Wikipedia's API and using the full name of the artist was able to retreive URLs to the images to include in the dataset. The bio was generated by GPT and added to the dataset. 

The data required some cleaning for artist's name, country, and converting the iiifurl to valid jpg urls. All images in the dashboard are URLs in the dataset and are loaded in dynamically as requested. All of this was done using Python.

### Design and Challenges
I aimed to keep the design minimal and pleasing to the eye. Additionally, I hoped the user would find the interface intuitive and fun to play around with to look at all the artwork.  

Ideally, I wanted the main display to act as an image carousel but PowerBI does not natively support this feature. Using a third-party app did not work well with the other functionalities of the dashboard, and so I used a matrix visualization to display the artwork at the top and a third-party image viewer to display the main image.
